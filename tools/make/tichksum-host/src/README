This is an upward compatible rewrite of the tichksum program.

It works on big endian, lillte endian, 32 bit and 64 bit machines.

It has options to add, verify and remove a checksum. When called with
no arguments, the default is compatible with the original program: If
a checksum is present, then verify it, else add it.
