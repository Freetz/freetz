TODO:
- classpath, jamvm
- give W900V a AVM-Webinterface (from 7150)
- bird and netsnmp don't build with more than one job

Latest changes:
- Fixed 'tar --exclude .svn' for dnsmasq, cifsmount and deco: option was not
  set for '*-package' targets (tar -c), but for unpack targets (tar -x).
- Remove "depends on DS_REPLACE_KERNEL" for iptables libs 
- Checking for and cleaning up Subversion directories in build/modified
  before packing firmware image
- Updated copyright notices and acknowledgements
- Updated MOTD to reflect DS-Mod_26 series (different ASCII art) 
- Fix menuconfig warning concerning download toolchain
- Remove kernel-toolchain from target-toolchain prerequisites 
- Add gcc-4.1.2 to target toolchain menu after it has been fixed
- FUSE module got lost when removed KERNEL_MODULES_DIR
- Add mirror for download toolchain
- Added, fixed and enhanced a few help texts for menuconfig in Config.in and
  toolchain/Config.in.
- Introducing detailed help texts for menuconfig's shared library section.
  Unfortunately, this blows up libs/Config.in immensely - even more so, because
  sub-menus cannot get their own help texts for technical reasons. So, for menus
  containing several entries there is a lot of redundancy (i.e. repetition). The
  worst example is iptables, but there are others as well.
- Add xdelta3 (for binary diffs) to build tools
- Added and enhanced menuconfig help texts for several packages: screen,
  matrixtunnel, lynx, dropbear, wol-cgi, mini_fo, lua, callmonitor, samba, mc,
  cifsmount, deco.
- Set tinyproxy autostart to manual
- Bump 5050 Firmware to 04.31
- Add patch and modules for mppe-mppc
- Increase MOD_LIMIT default to 61440
- Extra patch for soft-float problem
- Delete some unnecessary files
- Forgot to add patches for gdb 6.3 and 6.4
