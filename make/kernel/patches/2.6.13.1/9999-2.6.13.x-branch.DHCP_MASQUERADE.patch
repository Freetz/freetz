Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] Fix DHCP + MASQUERADE problem

In 2.6.13-rcX the MASQUERADE target was changed not to exclude local
packets for better source address consistency. This breaks DHCP clients
using UDP sockets when the DHCP requests are caught by a MASQUERADE rule
because the MASQUERADE target drops packets when no address is configured
on the outgoing interface. This patch makes it ignore packets with a
source address of 0.

Thanks to Rusty for this suggestion.
