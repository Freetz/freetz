	    JamVM - extremely small Java VM

		JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
		specification version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's
		(free and commercial) it is extremely small, with a stripped executable
		on PowerPC of only ~160K, and Intel 140K. However, unlike other small
		VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and
		includes support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References,
		class-unloading, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.

		Class Libraries: JamVM is designed to use the GNU Classpath Java class
		library. A number of classes are reference classes which must be
		modified for a particular VM. These are provided along with JamVM (see
		INSTALL). JamVM should always work with the latest development snapshot
		of Classpath (currently 0.93). It should also work with the latest
		version direct from CVS, and the upcoming 0.94 snapshot (but check the
		Classpath mailing lists for possible patches). Later snapshots of
		Classpath may also work, if no modifications have been made to the VM
		interface.
		
		Note, JamVM will not work with the class library from Sun or IBM's
		Virtual Machines.

	help
		libffi is a library that really only provides the lowest, machine
		dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface. A layer
		must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
		between the two languages. ffi stands for Foreign Function Interface.
		A foreign function interface is the popular name for the interface that
		allows code written in one language to call code written in another
		language.

		NOTE:
		At the moment, this library is only used by JamVM. If any other package
		should need it, the fixed dependency can be removed and the library be
		put into the general library section of menuconfig.
