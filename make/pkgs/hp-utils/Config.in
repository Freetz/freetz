		hp-utils is a collection of utility programs for
		HP printers. It's meant to be used on systems,
		which are unable to run the corresponding programs
		provided by HPLIP, e.g. because they only have
		limited memory and/or cpu power.
		hp-utils is primarily focused towards embedded systems,
		particularly towards the FRITZ!Box, a family
		of DSL routers produced by AVM.
