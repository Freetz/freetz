		The sg3_utils package contains utilities that send SCSI commands to devices.
		As well as devices on transports traditionally associated with SCSI (e.g.
		Fibre Channel (FCP), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and the SCSI Parallel
		Interface(SPI)) many other devices use SCSI command sets. ATAPI cd/dvd drives
		and SATA disks that connect via a translation layer or a bridge device are
		examples of devices that use SCSI command sets.

		This package is primarly used by the spindown cgi package. Note also that
		currently only sg_start is built and used, other tools may follow as needed.
