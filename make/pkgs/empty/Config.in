		empty is an utility that provides an interface to execute and/or
		interact with processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (PTYs).
		This tool is definitely useful in programming of shell scripts
		designed to communicate with interactive programs like telnet,
		ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases, empty can be the simplest
		replacement for TCL/expect or other similar programming tools.
