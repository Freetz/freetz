		Lua Scripting Language.

		Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for
		extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
		general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software.

		Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
		constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
		dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based
		virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental
		garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and
		rapid prototyping.

		A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to provide meta-mechanisms
		for implementing features, instead of providing a host of features
		directly in the language. For example, although Lua is not a pure
		object-oriented language, it does provide meta-mechanisms for
		implementing classes and inheritance. Lua's meta-mechanisms bring an
		economy of concepts and keep the language small, while allowing the
		semantics to be extended in unconventional ways. Extensible semantics
		is a distinguishing feature of Lua.

		Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application. This
		means that, besides syntax and semantics, Lua has an API that allows
		the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also to extend
		Lua with C functions. In this sense, Lua can be regarded as a language
		framework for building domain-specific languages.

		Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C,
		and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals
		are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The
		result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal
		in embedded systems too.
