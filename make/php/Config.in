		PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially
		suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. Much of its syntax
		is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features
		thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
		dynamically generated pages quickly.
