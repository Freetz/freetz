		Eclipse Mosquitto™ is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that implements
		the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides a lightweight method of
		carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable
		for "Internet of Things" messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices
		such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.
