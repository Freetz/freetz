	bool
	default n

menu "Settings"

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_DESKTOP
	depends on FREETZ_DISABLE_OPTION_BY_MAKING_IT_DEPEND_ON_NONEXISTING_SYMBOL
	bool "Enable compatibility for full-blown desktop systems (8kb)"
	default n
	help
	Enable applet options and features which are not essential.
	Many applet options have dedicated config options to (de)select them
	under that applet; this options enables those options which have no
	individual config item for them.

	Select this if you plan to use busybox on full-blown desktop machine
	with common Linux distro, which needs higher level of command-line
	compatibility.

	If you are preparing your build to be used on an embedded box
	where you have tighter control over the entire set of userspace
	tools, you can unselect this option for smaller code size.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_EXTRA_COMPAT
	bool "Provide compatible behavior for rare corner cases (bigger code)"
	default n
	help
	This option makes grep, sed etc handle rare corner cases
	(embedded NUL bytes and such). This makes code bigger and uses
	some GNU extensions in libc. You probably only need this option
	if you plan to run busybox on desktop.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEDORA_COMPAT
	depends on FREETZ_DISABLE_OPTION_BY_MAKING_IT_DEPEND_ON_NONEXISTING_SYMBOL
	bool "Building for Fedora distribution"
	default n
	help
	This option makes some tools behave like they do on Fedora.

	At the time of this writing (2017-08) this only affects uname:
	normally, uname -p (processor) and uname -i (platform)
	are shown as "unknown", but with this option uname -p
	shows the same string as uname -m (machine type),
	and so does uname -i unless machine type is i486/i586/i686 -
	then uname -i shows "i386".

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_INCLUDE_SUSv2
	bool "Enable obsolete features removed before SUSv3"
	default n
	help
	This option will enable backwards compatibility with SuSv2,
	specifically, old-style numeric options ('command -1 <file>')
	will be supported in head, tail, and fold. (Note: should
	affect renice too.)

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_LONG_OPTS
	bool "Support --long-options"
	default n
	help
	Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show applet usage messages"
	default n
	help
	Enabling this option, applets will show terse help messages
	when invoked with wrong arguments.
	If you do not want to show any (helpful) usage message when
	issuing wrong command syntax, you can say 'N' here,
	saving approximately 7k.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	All applets will show verbose help messages when invoked with --help.
	This will add a lot of text to the binary.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	Store usage messages in .bz2 compressed form, uncompress them
	on-the-fly when "APPLET --help" is run.

	If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	be noticeable. Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	and have very little memory, this might not be a win. Otherwise,
	you probably want this.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_LFS
	bool "Support files > 2 GB"
	default n
	help
	If you need to work with large files, enable this option.
	This will have no effect if your kernel or your C
	library lacks large file support for large files. Some of the
	programs that can benefit from large file support include dd, gzip,
	cp, mount, tar.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_PAM
	bool "Support PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)"
	default n
	help
	Use PAM in some applets (currently login and httpd) instead
	of direct access to password database.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default n
	help
	Enable if you want to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side. Otherwise, BSD style
	/dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	devpts mounted.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_UTMP
	bool "Support utmp file"
	default n
	help
	The file /var/run/utmp is used to track who is currently logged in.
	With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	will create and delete entries there.
	"who" applet requires this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_WTMP
	bool "Support wtmp file"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_UTMP
	help
	The file /var/run/wtmp is used to track when users have logged into
	and logged out of the system.
	With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	will append new entries there.
	"last" applet requires this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	bool "Support writing pidfiles"
	default n
	help
	This option makes some applets (e.g. crond, syslogd, inetd) write
	a pidfile at the configured PID_FILE_PATH.  It has no effect
	on applets which require pidfiles to run.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_PID_FILE_PATH
	string "Directory for pidfiles"
	default "/var/run"
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_PIDFILE || FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_CROND_SPECIAL_TIMES
	help
	This is the default path where pidfiles are created.  Applets which
	allow you to set the pidfile path on the command line will override
	this value.  The option has no effect on applets that require you to
	specify a pidfile path.  When crond has the 'Support special times'
	option enabled, the 'crond.reboot' file is also stored here.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_BUSYBOX
	bool "Include busybox applet"
	default n
	help
	The busybox applet provides general help message and allows
	the included applets to be listed.  It also provides
	optional --install command to create applet links. If you unselect
	this option, running busybox without any arguments will give
	just a cryptic error message:

	$ busybox
	busybox: applet not found

	Running "busybox APPLET [ARGS...]" will still work, of course.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SHOW_SCRIPT
	bool "Support --show SCRIPT"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_BUSYBOX

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_INSTALLER
	bool "Support --install [-s] to install applet links at runtime"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_BUSYBOX
	help
	Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support. This will allow you to use
	busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
	applets that are compiled into busybox.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_INSTALL_NO_USR
	bool "Don't use /usr"
	default n
	help
	Disable use of /usr. "busybox --install" and "make install"
	will install applets only to /bin and /sbin,
	never to /usr/bin or /usr/sbin.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SUID
	bool "Drop SUID state for most applets"
	default n
	help
	With this option you can install the busybox binary belonging
	to root with the suid bit set, enabling some applets to perform
	root-level operations even when run by ordinary users
	(for example, mounting of user mounts in fstab needs this).

	With this option enabled, busybox drops privileges for applets
	that don't need root access, before entering their main() function.

	If you are really paranoid and don't want even initial busybox code
	to run under root for every applet, build two busybox binaries with
	different applets in them (and the appropriate symlinks pointing
	to each binary), and only set the suid bit on the one that needs it.

	Some applets which require root rights (need suid bit on the binary
	or to be run by root) and will refuse to execute otherwise:
	crontab, login, passwd, su, vlock, wall.

	The applets which will use root rights if they have them
	(via suid bit, or because run by root), but would try to work
	without root right nevertheless:
	findfs, ping[6], traceroute[6], mount.

	Note that if you DO NOT select this option, but DO make busybox
	suid root, ALL applets will run under root, which is a huge
	security hole (think "cp /some/file /etc/passwd").

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	bool "Enable SUID configuration via /etc/busybox.conf"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SUID
	help
	Allow the SUID/SGID state of an applet to be determined at runtime
	by checking /etc/busybox.conf. (This is sort of a poor man's sudo.)
	The format of this file is as follows:

	APPLET = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] [USER.GROUP]

	s: USER or GROUP is allowed to execute APPLET.
	   APPLET will run under USER or GROUP
	   (regardless of who's running it).
	S: USER or GROUP is NOT allowed to execute APPLET.
	   APPLET will run under USER or GROUP.
	   This option is not very sensical.
	x: USER/GROUP/others are allowed to execute APPLET.
	   No UID/GID change will be done when it is run.
	-: USER/GROUP/others are not allowed to execute APPLET.

	An example might help:

	|[SUID]
	|su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with
	|                # euid=0,egid=0
	|su = ssx        # exactly the same
	|
	|mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members
	|                      # of group disk (but not anyone else)
	|                      # and runs with euid=0 (egid is not changed)
	|
	|cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

	The file has to be owned by user root, group root and has to be
	writeable only by root:
		(chown 0.0 /etc/busybox.conf; chmod 600 /etc/busybox.conf)
	The busybox executable has to be owned by user root, group
	root and has to be setuid root for this to work:
		(chown 0.0 /bin/busybox; chmod 4755 /bin/busybox)

	bool "Suppress warning message if /etc/busybox.conf is not readable"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	help
	/etc/busybox.conf should be readable by the user needing the SUID,
	check this option to avoid users to be notified about missing
	permissions.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX__NOEXEC_NOFORK_OPTIMIZATIONS
	bool "exec prefers applets"
	default n
	help
	This is an experimental option which directs applets about to
	call 'exec' to try and find an applicable busybox applet before
	searching the PATH. This is typically done by exec'ing
	/proc/self/exe.

	This may affect shell, find -exec, xargs and similar applets.
	They will use applets even if /bin/APPLET -> busybox link
	is missing (or is not a link to busybox). However, this causes
	problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc and with ps/top
	(command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets started this way).

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	string "Path to busybox executable"
	default "/proc/self/exe"
	help
	When applets need to run other applets, busybox
	sometimes needs to exec() itself. When the /proc filesystem is
	mounted, /proc/self/exe always points to the currently running
	executable. If you haven't got /proc, set this to wherever you
	want to run busybox from.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_SELINUX
	bool "Support NSA Security Enhanced Linux"
	default n
	help
	Enable support for SELinux in applets ls, ps, and id. Also provide
	the option of compiling in SELinux applets.

	If you do not have a complete SELinux userland installed, this stuff
	will not compile.  Specifially, libselinux 1.28 or better is
	directly required by busybox. If the installation is located in a
	non-standard directory, provide it by invoking make as follows:

		CFLAGS=-I<libselinux-include-path> \
		LDFLAGS=-L<libselinux-lib-path> \
		make

	Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	bool "Clean up all memory before exiting (usually not needed)"
	default n
	help
	As a size optimization, busybox normally exits without explicitly
	freeing dynamically allocated memory or closing files. This saves
	space since the OS will clean up for us, but it can confuse debuggers
	like valgrind, which report tons of memory and resource leaks.

	Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
	things up manually.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SYSLOG_INFO
	bool "Support LOG_INFO level syslog messages"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	Applets which send their output to syslog use either LOG_INFO or
	LOG_ERR log levels, but by disabling this option all messages will
	be logged at the LOG_ERR level, saving just under 200 bytes.

# These are auto-selected by other options

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	bool #No description makes it a hidden option
	default n
	#help
	#This option is auto-selected when you select any applet which may
	#send its output to syslog. You do not need to select it manually.

	bool "Build static binary (no shared libs)"
	default n
	help
	If you want to build a static binary, which does not use
	or require any shared libraries, enable this option.
	Static binaries are larger, but do not require functioning
	dynamic libraries to be present, which is important if used
	as a system rescue tool.

	Build a shared library libbusybox.so.N.N.N which contains all
	busybox code.

	This feature allows every applet to be built as a really tiny
	separate executable linked against the library:
	|$ size 0_lib/l*

	help
	If your CPU architecture doesn't allow for sharing text/rodata
	sections of running binaries, but allows for runtime dynamic
	libraries, this option will allow you to reduce memory footprint
	when you have many different applets running at once.

	If your CPU architecture allows for sharing text/rodata,
	having single binary is more optimal.

	Each applet will be a tiny program, dynamically linked
	against libbusybox.so.N.N.N.

### config BUILD_AT_ONCE
###	bool "Compile all sources at once"
###	default n
###	help
###	Normally each source-file is compiled with one invocation of
###	the compiler.
###	If you set this option, all sources are compiled at once.
###	This gives the compiler more opportunities to optimize which can
###	result in smaller and/or faster binaries.
###
###	Setting this option will consume alot of memory, e.g. if you
###	enable all applets with all features, gcc uses more than 300MB
###	RAM during compilation of busybox.
###
###	This option is most likely only beneficial for newer compilers
###	such as gcc-4.1 and above.

	default ""
	help
	If you want to build busybox with a cross compiler, then you
	will need to set this to the cross-compiler prefix, for example,

	prompt "Additional debugging library"
	default FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_NO_DEBUG_LIB
	help
	Using an additional debugging library will make busybox become
	considerably larger and will cause it to run more slowly. You
	should always leave this option disabled for production use.

	dmalloc support:
	----------------
	This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	detector. To enable dmalloc, before running busybox you will
	want to properly set your environment, for example:
		export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command
	dmalloc -p log-stats -p log-non-free -p log-bad-space \
		-p log-elapsed-time -p check-fence -p check-heap \
		-p check-lists -p check-blank -p check-funcs -p realloc-copy \
		-p allow-free-null

	Electric-fence support:
	-----------------------
	This enables compiling with Electric-fence support. Electric
	fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	accesses. This support will make busybox be considerably larger
	and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.

	bool "Use the end of BSS page"
	default n
	help
	Attempt to reclaim a small unused part of BSS.

	Executables have the following parts:
	= read-only executable code and constants, also known as "text"
	= read-write data
	= non-initialized (zeroed on demand) data, also known as "bss"

	At link time, "text" is padded to a full page. At runtime, all "text"
	pages are mapped RO and executable.

	"Data" starts on the next page boundary, but is not padded
	to a full page at the end. "Bss" starts wherever "data" ends.
	At runtime, "data" pages are mapped RW and they are file-backed
	(this includes a small portion of "bss" which may live in the last
	partial page of "data").
	Pages which are fully in "bss" are mapped to anonymous memory.

	"Bss" end is usually not page-aligned. There is an unused space
	in the last page. Linker marks its start with the "_end" symbol.

	This option will attempt to use that space for bb_common_bufsiz1[]
	array. If it fits after _end, it will be used, and COMMON_BUFSIZE
	will be enlarged from its guaranteed minimum size of 1 kbyte.
	This may require recompilation a second time, since value of _end
	is known only after final link.

	If you are getting a build error like this:
		appletlib.c:(.text.main+0xd): undefined reference to '_end'
	disable this option.

	Some C libraries reserve a few real-time signals for internal
	use, and adjust the values of SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX seen by

	- Put them on stack. For some very small machines with limited stack
	space, this can be deadly. For most folks, this works just fine.
	- Put them in BSS. This works beautifully for computers with a real

	Any character with Unicode value bigger than this is assumed

	Typical values are:
	126 - ASCII only
	767 (0x2ff) - there are no combining chars in [0..767] range

	In Linux, kernel has a special filesystem, rootfs, which is initially
	mounted on /. It contains initramfs data, if kernel is configured
	to have one. Usually, another file system is mounted over / early
	in boot process, and therefore most tools which manipulate
	mount table, such as df, will skip rootfs entry.

	However, some systems do not mount anything on /.
	If you need to configure busybox for one of these systems,

	Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	(which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	or unmounted, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	run-init deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	then execs the specified init program.

	util-linux has a similar tool, switch-root.
	run-init differs by also having a "-d CAPS_TO_DROP" option.

	default n
	help
	If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password

	(glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
	order for the password and group functions to work. This generally
	makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
	smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
	works). When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
	PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot. And if you
	want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
	/lib/libnss_* libraries.

	If you need to use glibc's nsswitch.conf mechanism

	help
	Busybox has internal DES and MD5 crypt functions.
	They produce results which are identical to corresponding
	standard C library functions.

	If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's
	crypt functions. Most C libraries use large (~70k)
	static buffers there, and also combine them with more general
	DES encryption/decryption.

	For busybox, having large static buffers is undesirable,
	especially on NOMMU machines. Busybox also doesn't need
	DES encryption/decryption and can do with smaller code.

	If you enable this option, it will add about 4.8k of code

	default n
	help
	Build smaller (~1.5 kbytes), simplified module tools.

	This option by itself does not enable any applets -
	you need to select applets individually below.

	With this option modprobe does not require modules.dep file
	and does not use /etc/modules.conf file.
	It scans module files in /lib/modules/`uname -r` and
	determines dependencies and module alias names on the fly.
	This may make module loading slower, most notably
	when one needs to load module by alias (this requires
	scanning through module _bodies_).

	At the first attempt to load a module by alias modprobe
	will try to generate modules.dep.bb file in order to speed up
	future loads by alias. Failure to do so (read-only /lib/modules,
	etc) is not reported, and future modprobes will be slow too.

	NB: modules.dep.bb file format is not compatible
	with modules.dep file as created/used by standard module tools.

	Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted
	partitions in the file "/etc/mtab". These days, the kernel exports
	the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	your kernel.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_BC
	bool "bc (45 kb)"
	default n
	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_FEATURE_DC_BIG
	help
	bc is a command-line, arbitrary-precision calculator with a
	Turing-complete language. See the GNU bc manual
	(https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/bc.html) and bc spec
	(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html).

	This bc has five differences to the GNU bc:
	  1) The period (.) is a shortcut for "last", as in the BSD bc.
	  2) Arrays are copied before being passed as arguments to
	     functions. This behavior is required by the bc spec.
	  3) Arrays can be passed to the builtin "length" function to get
	     the number of elements in the array. This prints "1":
		a[0] = 0; length(a[])
	  4) The precedence of the boolean "not" operator (!) is equal to
	     that of the unary minus (-) negation operator. This still
	     allows POSIX-compliant scripts to work while somewhat
	     preserving expected behavior (versus C) and making parsing
	     easier.
	  5) "read()" accepts expressions, not only numeric literals.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_DC
	bool "dc (36 kb)"
	default n
	help
	dc is a reverse-polish notation command-line calculator which
	supports unlimited precision arithmetic. See the FreeBSD man page
	(https://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/1/dc/) and GNU dc manual
	(https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/dc-1.05/html_mono/dc.html).

	This dc has a few differences from the two above:
	  1) When printing a byte stream (command "P"), this dc follows what
	     the FreeBSD dc does.
	  2) Implements the GNU extensions for divmod ("~") and
	     modular exponentiation ("|").
	  3) Implements all FreeBSD extensions, except for "J" and "M".
	  4) Like the FreeBSD dc, this dc supports extended registers.
	     However, they are implemented differently. When it encounters
	     whitespace where a register should be, it skips the whitespace.
	     If the character following is not a lowercase letter, an error
	     is issued. Otherwise, the register name is parsed by the
	     following regex: [a-z][a-z0-9_]*
	     This generally means that register names will be surrounded by
	     whitespace. Examples:
		l idx s temp L index S temp2 < do_thing
	     Also note that, like the FreeBSD dc, extended registers are not
	     allowed unless the "-x" option is given.

		http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html

	Note that for busybox telnetd to work you need several things:
	First of all, your kernel needs:
		  CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y

	Next, you need a /dev/pts directory on your root filesystem:

		  $ ls -ld /dev/pts
		  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Sep 23 13:21 /dev/pts/

	Next you need the pseudo terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx:

		  $ ls -la /dev/ptmx
		  crw-rw-rw-  1 root tty 5, 2 Sep 23 13:55 /dev/ptmx

	Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.
	Next, you need to mount the devpts filesystem on /dev/pts using:

		  mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

	You need to be sure that busybox has LOGIN and
	FEATURE_SUID enabled. And finally, you should make
	certain that busybox has been installed setuid root:

		chown root.root /bin/busybox
		chmod 4755 /bin/busybox

	with all that done, telnetd _should_ work....

	Note:
	On NOMMU machines, ssl_helper applet should be available

	Note: currently, TLS code only makes TLS I/O work, it
	does *not* check that the peer is who it claims to be, etc.
	IOW: it uses peer-supplied public keys to establish encryption
	and signing keys, then encrypts and signs outgoing data and
	decrypts incoming data.
	It does not check signature hashes on the incoming data:
	this means that attackers manipulating TCP packets can
	send altered data and we unknowingly receive garbage.
	(This check might be relatively easy to add).
	It does not check public key's certificate:
	this means that the peer may be an attacker impersonating
	the server we think we are talking to.

	If you think this is unacceptable, consider this. As more and more
	servers switch to HTTPS-only operation, without such "crippled"
	TLS code it is *impossible* to simply download a kernel source
	from kernel.org. Which can in real world translate into
	"my small automatic tooling to build cross-compilers from sources
	no longer works, I need to additionally keep a local copy
	of ~4 megabyte source tarball of a SSL library and ~2 megabyte
	source of wget, need to compile and built both before I can
	download anything. All this despite the fact that the build
	is done in a QEMU sandbox on a machine with absolutely nothing
	worth stealing, so I don't care if someone would go to a lot
	of trouble to intercept my HTTPS download to send me an altered
	kernel tarball".

	If you still think this is unacceptable, send patches.

	patches, but do want to waste bandwidth expaining how wrong
	it is, you will be ignored.

	Try to use openssl to handle HTTPS.

	OpenSSL has a simple SSL client for debug purposes.
	If you select this option, wget will effectively run:
	"openssl s_client -quiet -connect hostname:443
	-servername hostname 2>/dev/null" and pipe its data
	through it. -servername is not used if hostname is numeric.
	Note inconvenient API: host resolution is done twice,
	and there is no guarantee openssl's idea of IPv6 address
	format is the same as ours.
	Another problem is that s_client prints debug information
	to stderr, and it needs to be suppressed. This means
	all error messages get suppressed too.
	openssl is also a big binary, often dynamically linked
	against ~15 libraries.

	If openssl can't be executed, internal TLS code will be used
	(if you enabled it); if openssl can be executed but fails later,
	wget can't detect this, and download will fail.

	By default TLS verification is performed, unless

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V133_CTTYHACK
	bool "cttyhack (2.4 kb)"
	default n
	help
	One common problem reported on the mailing list is the "can't
	access tty; job control turned off" error message, which typically
	appears when one tries to use a shell with stdin/stdout on
	/dev/console.
	This device is special - it cannot be a controlling tty.

	The proper solution is to use the correct device instead of
	/dev/console.

	cttyhack provides a "quick and dirty" solution to this problem.
	It analyzes stdin with various ioctls, trying to determine whether
	it is a /dev/ttyN or /dev/ttySN (virtual terminal or serial line).
	On Linux it also checks sysfs for a pointer to the active console.
	If cttyhack is able to find the real console device, it closes
	stdin/out/err and reopens that device.
	Then it executes the given program. Opening the device will make
	that device a controlling tty. This may require cttyhack
	to be a session leader.

	Example for /etc/inittab (for busybox init):

	::respawn:/bin/cttyhack /bin/sh

	Starting an interactive shell from boot shell script:

	setsid cttyhack sh

	Giving controlling tty to shell running with PID 1:

	# exec cttyhack sh

	Without cttyhack, you need to know exact tty name,
	and do something like this:

	# exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1'

	Starting getty on a controlling tty from a shell script:

	# getty 115200 $(cttyhack)

	This option causes busybox shells to use busybox applets
	in preference to executables in the PATH whenever possible. For
	example, entering the command 'ifconfig' into the shell would cause
	busybox to use the ifconfig busybox applet. Specifying the fully
	qualified executable name, such as '/sbin/ifconfig' will still
	execute the /sbin/ifconfig executable on the filesystem. This option
	is generally used when creating a statically linked version of busybox
	for use as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your system.

	This is implemented by re-execing /proc/self/exe (typically)
	with right parameters.
