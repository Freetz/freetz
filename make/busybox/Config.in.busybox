config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_DESKTOP
	bool "Enable options for full-blown desktop systems"
	default n
	help
	  Enable options and features which are not essential.
	  Select this only if you plan to use busybox on full-blown
	  desktop machine with common Linux distro, not on an embedded box.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_EXTRA_COMPAT
	bool "Provide compatible behavior for rare corner cases (bigger code)"
	default n
	help
	  This option makes grep, sed etc handle rare corner cases
	  (embedded NUL bytes and such). This makes code bigger and uses
	  some GNU extensions in libc. You probably only need this option
	  if you plan to run busybox on desktop.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_INCLUDE_SUSv2
	bool "Enable obsolete features removed before SUSv3"
	default n
	help
	  This option will enable backwards compatibility with SuSv2,
	  specifically, old-style numeric options ('command -1 <file>')
	  will be supported in head, tail, and fold. (Note: should
	  affect renice too.)

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_USE_PORTABLE_CODE
	bool "Avoid using GCC-specific code constructs"
	default n
	help
	  Use this option if you are trying to compile busybox with
	  compiler other than gcc.
	  If you do use gcc, this option may needlessly increase code size.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	bool "Enable Linux-specific applets and features"
	default n
	help
	  For the most part, busybox requires only POSIX compatibility
	  from the target system, but some applets and features use
	  Linux-specific interfaces.

	  Answering 'N' here will disable such applets and hide the
	  corresponding configuration options.

choice
	prompt "Buffer allocation policy"
	default FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_ON_STACK
	help
	  There are 3 ways BusyBox can handle buffer allocations:
	  - Use malloc. This costs code size for the call to xmalloc.
	  - Put them on stack. For some very small machines with limited stack
	    space, this can be deadly. For most folks, this works just fine.
	  - Put them in BSS. This works beautifully for computers with a real
	    MMU (and OS support), but wastes runtime RAM for uCLinux. This
	    behavior was the only one available for BusyBox versions 0.48 and
	    earlier.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_BUFFERS_USE_MALLOC
	bool "Allocate with Malloc"

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_ON_STACK

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show applet usage messages"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this option, BusyBox applets will show terse help messages
	  when invoked with wrong arguments.
	  If you do not want to show any (helpful) usage message when
	  issuing wrong command syntax, you can say 'N' here,
	  saving approximately 7k.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show verbose help messages when
	  busybox is invoked with --help. This will add a lot of text to the
	  busybox binary. In the default configuration, this will add about
	  13k, but it can add much more depending on your configuration.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  Store usage messages in .bz compressed form, uncompress them
	  on-the-fly when <applet> --help is called.

	  If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	  bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	  be noticeable. Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	  and have very little memory, this might not be a win. Otherwise,
	  you probably want this.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_INSTALLER
	bool "Support --install [-s] to install applet links at runtime"
	default n
	help
	  Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support. This will allow you to use
	  busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
	  applets that are compiled into busybox.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_INSTALL_NO_USR
	bool "Don't use /usr"
	default n
	help
	  Disable use of /usr. busybox --install and "make install"
	  will install applets only to /bin and /sbin,
	  never to /usr/bin or /usr/sbin.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LOCALE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable locale support (system needs locale for this to work)"
	default n
	depends on !FREETZ_TARGET_UCLIBC_0_9_28
	help
	  Enable this if your system has locale support and you would like
	  busybox to support locale settings.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT
	bool "Support Unicode"
	default n
	help
	  This makes various applets aware that one byte is not
	  one character on screen.

	  Busybox aims to eventually work correctly with Unicode displays.
	  Any older encodings are not guaranteed to work.
	  Probably by the time when busybox will be fully Unicode-clean,
	  other encodings will be mainly of historic interest.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_USING_LOCALE
	bool "Use libc routines for Unicode (else uses internal ones)"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT && FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LOCALE_SUPPORT
	help
	  With this option on, Unicode support is implemented using libc
	  routines. Otherwise, internal implementation is used.
	  Internal implementation is smaller.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CHECK_UNICODE_IN_ENV
	bool "Check $LANG environment variable"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT && !FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_USING_LOCALE
	help
	  With this option on, Unicode support is activated
	  only if LANG variable has the value of the form "xxxx.utf8"

	  Otherwise, Unicode support will be always enabled and active.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_SUBST_WCHAR
	int "Character code to substitute unprintable characters with"
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT
	default 0
	help
	  Typical values are 63 for '?' (works with any output device),
	  30 for ASCII substitute control code,
	  65533 (0xfffd) for Unicode replacement character.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LAST_SUPPORTED_WCHAR
	int "Range of supported Unicode characters"
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT
	default 0
	help
	  Any character with Unicode value bigger than this is assumed
	  to be non-printable on output device. Many applets replace
	  such chars with substitution character.

	  The idea is that many valid printable Unicode chars are
	  nevertheless are not displayed correctly. Think about
	  combining charachers, double-wide hieroglyphs, obscure
	  characters in dozens of ancient scripts...
	  Many terminals, terminal emulators, xterms etc will fail
	  to handle them correctly. Choose the smallest value
	  which suits your needs.

	  Typical values are:
	  126 - ASCII only
	  767 (0x2ff) - there are no combining chars in [0..767] range
			(the range includes Latin 1, Latin Ext. A and B),
			code is ~700 bytes smaller for this case.
	  4351 (0x10ff) - there are no double-wide chars in [0..4351] range,
			code is ~300 bytes smaller for this case.
	  12799 (0x31ff) - nearly all non-ideographic characters are
			available in [0..12799] range, including
			East Asian scripts like katakana, hiragana, hangul,
			bopomofo...
	  0 - off, any valid printable Unicode character will be printed.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_COMBINING_WCHARS
	bool "Allow zero-width Unicode characters on output"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT
	help
	  With this option off, any Unicode char with width of 0
	  is substituted on output.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_WIDE_WCHARS
	bool "Allow wide Unicode characters on output"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT
	help
	  With this option off, any Unicode char with width > 1
	  is substituted on output.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_BIDI_SUPPORT
	bool "Bidirectional character-aware line input"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT && !FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_USING_LOCALE
	help
	  With this option on, right-to-left Unicode characters
	  are treated differently on input (e.g. cursor movement).

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_NEUTRAL_TABLE
	bool "In bidi input, support non-ASCII neutral chars too"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_BIDI_SUPPORT
	help
	  In most cases it's enough to treat only ASCII non-letters
	  (i.e. punctuation, numbers and space) as characters
	  with neutral directionality.
	  With this option on, more extensive (and bigger) table
	  of neutral chars will be used.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_PRESERVE_BROKEN
	bool "Make it possible to enter sequences of chars which are not Unicode"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_UNICODE_SUPPORT
	help
	  With this option on, on line-editing input (such as used by shells)
	  invalid UTF-8 bytes are not substituted with the selected
	  substitution character.
	  For example, this means that entering 'l', 's', ' ', 0xff, [Enter]
	  at shell prompt will list file named 0xff (single char name
	  with char value 255), not file named '?'.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LONG_OPTS
	bool "Support for --long-options"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	  style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default n
	help
	  Enable if you want BusyBox to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	  busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	  and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side. Otherwise, BSD style
	  /dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	  devpts mounted.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	bool "Clean up all memory before exiting (usually not needed)"
	default n
	help
	  As a size optimization, busybox normally exits without explicitly
	  freeing dynamically allocated memory or closing files. This saves
	  space since the OS will clean up for us, but it can confuse debuggers
	  like valgrind, which report tons of memory and resource leaks.

	  Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
	  things up manually.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_UTMP
	bool "Support utmp file"
	default n
	help
	  The file /var/run/utmp is used to track who is currently logged in.
	  With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	  will create and delete entries there.
	  "who" applet requires this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_WTMP
	bool "Support wtmp file"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_UTMP
	help
	  The file /var/run/wtmp is used to track when users have logged into
	  and logged out of the system.
	  With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	  will append new entries there.
	  "last" applet requires this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	bool "Support writing pidfiles"
	default n
	help
	  This option makes some applets (e.g. crond, syslogd, inetd) write
	  a pidfile at the configured PID_FILE_PATH.  It has no effect
	  on applets which require pidfiles to run.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_PID_FILE_PATH
	string "Path to directory for pidfile"
	default "/var/run"
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	help
	  This is the default path where pidfiles are created.  Applets which
	  allow you to set the pidfile path on the command line will override
	  this value.  The option has no effect on applets that require you to
	  specify a pidfile path.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SUID
	bool "Support for SUID/SGID handling"
	default n
	help
	  With this option you can install the busybox binary belonging
	  to root with the suid bit set, enabling some applets to perform
	  root-level operations even when run by ordinary users
	  (for example, mounting of user mounts in fstab needs this).

	  Busybox will automatically drop privileges for applets
	  that don't need root access.

	  If you are really paranoid and don't want to do this, build two
	  busybox binaries with different applets in them (and the appropriate
	  symlinks pointing to each binary), and only set the suid bit on the
	  one that needs it.

	  The applets which require root rights (need suid bit or
	  to be run by root) and will refuse to execute otherwise:
	  crontab, login, passwd, su, vlock, wall.

	  The applets which will use root rights if they have them
	  (via suid bit, or because run by root), but would try to work
	  without root right nevertheless:
	  findfs, ping[6], traceroute[6], mount.

	  Note that if you DONT select this option, but DO make busybox
	  suid root, ALL applets will run under root, which is a huge
	  security hole (think "cp /some/file /etc/passwd").

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	bool "Runtime SUID/SGID configuration via /etc/busybox.conf"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SUID
	help
	  Allow the SUID / SGID state of an applet to be determined at runtime
	  by checking /etc/busybox.conf. (This is sort of a poor man's sudo.)
	  The format of this file is as follows:

	  APPLET = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] [USER.GROUP]

	  s: USER or GROUP is allowed to execute APPLET.
	     APPLET will run under USER or GROUP
	     (reagardless of who's running it).
	  S: USER or GROUP is NOT allowed to execute APPLET.
	     APPLET will run under USER or GROUP.
	     This option is not very sensical.
	  x: USER/GROUP/others are allowed to execute APPLET.
	     No UID/GID change will be done when it is run.
	  -: USER/GROUP/others are not allowed to execute APPLET.

	  An example might help:

	  [SUID]
	  su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with
	                  # euid=0/egid=0
	  su = ssx        # exactly the same

	  mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members
	                        # of group disk (but not anyone else)
	                        # and runs with euid=0 (egid is not changed)

	  cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

	  The file has to be owned by user root, group root and has to be
	  writeable only by root:
	        (chown 0.0 /etc/busybox.conf; chmod 600 /etc/busybox.conf)
	  The busybox executable has to be owned by user root, group
	  root and has to be setuid root for this to work:
	        (chown 0.0 /bin/busybox; chmod 4755 /bin/busybox)

	default n
	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  Enable support for SELinux in applets ls, ps, and id. Also provide
	  the option of compiling in SELinux applets.

	  If you do not have a complete SELinux userland installed, this stuff
	  will not compile. Go visit
		http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/index.html
	  to download the necessary stuff to allow busybox to compile with
	  this option enabled. Specifially, libselinux 1.28 or better is
	  directly required by busybox. If the installation is located in a
	  non-standard directory, provide it by invoking make as follows:
		CFLAGS=-I<libselinux-include-path> \
		LDFLAGS=-L<libselinux-lib-path> \
		make

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	bool "exec prefers applets"
	default n
	help
	  This is an experimental option which directs applets about to
	  call 'exec' to try and find an applicable busybox applet before
	  searching the PATH. This is typically done by exec'ing
	  /proc/self/exe.
	  This may affect shell, find -exec, xargs and similar applets.
	  They will use applets even if /bin/<applet> -> busybox link
	  is missing (or is not a link to busybox). However, this causes
	  problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc and with ps/top
	  (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets started this way).

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	string "Path to BusyBox executable"
	default "/bin/busybox"
	help
	  When Busybox applets need to run other busybox applets, BusyBox
	  sometimes needs to exec() itself. When the /proc filesystem is

	  Using an additional debugging library will make BusyBox become

	  should always leave this option disabled for production use.

	  dmalloc support:
	  ----------------
	  This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	  which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	  detector. To enable dmalloc, before running busybox you will
	  want to properly set your environment, for example:
	    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	  The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command
	    dmalloc -p log-stats -p log-non-free -p log-bad-space \
	       -p log-elapsed-time -p check-fence -p check-heap \
	       -p check-lists -p check-blank -p check-funcs -p realloc-copy \
	       -p allow-free-null

	  Electric-fence support:
	  -----------------------
	  This enables compiling with Electric-fence support. Electric
	  fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	  your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	  accesses. This support will make BusyBox be considerable larger
	  and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	  you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.

	  The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner,
	  and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
	  extraction.

	  The stored filename is limited to 15 characters. (for more information
	  see long filename support).
	  ar has 60 bytes of overheads for every stored file.

	  This implementation of ar can extract archives, it cannot create or

	help
	  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password

	  (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
	  configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in

	  makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

	  Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
	  system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
	  smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
	  works). When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_CRYPT

	help
	  Busybox has internal DES and MD5 crypt functions.
	  They produce results which are identical to corresponding
	  standard C library functions.

	  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's
	  crypt functions. Most C libraries use large (~70k)
	  static buffers there, and also combine them with more general
	  DES encryption/decryption.

	  For busybox, having large static buffers is undesirable,
	  especially on NOMMU machines. Busybox also doesn't need
	  DES encryption/decryption and can do with smaller code.

	  If you enable this option, it will add about 4.8k of code
	  if you are building dynamically linked executable.

	  Simplified modutils.

	  With this option modprobe does not require modules.dep file
	  and does not use /etc/modules.conf file.
	  It scans module files in /lib/modules/`uname -r` and
	  determines dependencies and module alias names on the fly.
	  This may make module loading slower, most notably
	  when one needs to load module by alias (this requires
	  scanning through module _bodies_).

	  At the first attempt to load a module by alias modprobe
	  will try to generate modules.dep.bb file in order to speed up
	  future loads by alias. Failure to do so (read-only /lib/modules,
	  etc) is not reported, and future modprobes will be slow too.

	  NB: modules.dep.bb file format is not compatible
	  with modules.dep file as created/used by standard module tools.

	  Additional module parameters can be stored in
	  /etc/modules/$module_name files.

	  Apart from modprobe, other utilities are also provided:
	  - insmod is an alias to modprobe
	  - rmmod is an alias to modprobe -r
	  - depmod generates modules.dep.bb

	  As of 2008-07, this code is experimental. It is 14kb smaller

	  The switch_root utility is used from initramfs to select a new
	  root device. Under initramfs, you have to use this instead of
	  pivot_root. (Stop reading here if you don't care why.)

	  Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	  (which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	  or unmounted*, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	  switch_root deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	  does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	  then execs the specified init program.

	  * Because the Linux kernel uses rootfs internally as the starting

	help
	  Enabling this feature allows automatic mounting of files (containing
	  filesystem images) via the linux kernel's loopback devices.
	  The mount command will detect you are trying to mount a file instead
	  of a block device, and transparently associate the file with a
	  loopback device. The umount command will also free that loopback
	  device.

	  You can still use the 'losetup' utility (to manually associate files
	  with loop devices) if you need to do something advanced, such as
	  specify an offset or cryptographic options to the loopback device.
	  (If you don't want umount to free the loop device, use "umount -D".)

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP_CREATE

	  Linux kernels >= 2.6.24 support unlimited loopback devices. They are

	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_MOUNT_FAKE
	help
	  Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted
	  partitions in the file "/etc/mtab". These days, the kernel exports
	  the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	  the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	  a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	  The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	  your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	  If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	  example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	  features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	  that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	  by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	  that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	  About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	  your kernel.

	  Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.

	  In this example, inetd passes _listening_ socket_ as fd 0

	  telnetd will wait for connections until all existing
	  connections are closed, and no new connections
	  appear during 10 seconds. Then it exits, and inetd continues

	help
	  One common problem reported on the mailing list is the "can't

	  appears when one tries to use a shell with stdin/stdout on
	  /dev/console.
	  This device is special - it cannot be a controlling tty.

	  The proper solution is to use the correct device instead of
	  /dev/console.

	  cttyhack provides a "quick and dirty" solution to this problem.
	  It analyzes stdin with various ioctls, trying to determine whether
	  it is a /dev/ttyN or /dev/ttySN (virtual terminal or serial line).
	  On Linux it also checks sysfs for a pointer to the active console.
	  If cttyhack is able to find the real console device, it closes
	  stdin/out/err and reopens that device.
	  Then it executes the given program. Opening the device will make
	  that device a controlling tty. This may require cttyhack
	  to be a session leader.

	  Example for /etc/inittab (for busybox init):

	  ::respawn:/bin/cttyhack /bin/sh

	  Starting an interactive shell from boot shell script:

	  setsid cttyhack sh

	  Giving controlling tty to shell running with PID 1:

	  # exec cttyhack sh

	  Without cttyhack, you need to know exact tty name,
	  and do something like this:

	  # exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1'

	  Starting getty on a controlling tty from a shell script:

	  # getty 115200 $(cttyhack)

	  This option causes busybox shells to use busybox applets
	  in preference to executables in the PATH whenever possible. For
	  example, entering the command 'ifconfig' into the shell would cause
	  busybox to use the ifconfig busybox applet. Specifying the fully
	  qualified executable name, such as '/sbin/ifconfig' will still
	  execute the /sbin/ifconfig executable on the filesystem. This option
	  is generally used when creating a statically linked version of busybox
	  for use as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your system.

	  This is implemented by re-execing /proc/self/exe (typically)
	  with right parameters. Some selected applets ("NOFORK" applets)
	  can even be executed without creating new process.
	  Instead, busybox will call <applet>_main() internally.

	  However, this causes problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc
	  and with ps/top (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets
	  started this way).
# untrue?
#	  Note that this will *also* cause applets to take precedence
#	  over shell builtins of the same name. So turning this on will
#	  eliminate any performance gained by turning on the builtin "echo"
#	  and "test" commands in ash.
# untrue?
#	  Note that when using this option, the shell will attempt to directly
#	  run '/bin/busybox'. If you do not have the busybox binary sitting in
#	  that exact location with that exact name, this option will not work at
#	  all.

	  This will be done only for some applets (those which are marked

	  otherwise system logs can eventually fill up your
	  entire filesystem, which may cause your system to
	  break badly.

	default 16
	range 4 2147483647

	  This option sets the size of the circular buffer
	  used to record system log messages.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LOGREAD
	bool "logread"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG
	help
	  If you enabled Circular Buffer support, you almost
	  certainly want to enable this feature as well. This
	  utility will allow you to read the messages that are
	  stored in the syslogd circular buffer.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_LOGREAD_REDUCED_LOCKING
	bool "Double buffering"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LOGREAD
	help
	  'logread' ouput to slow serial terminals can have
	  side effects on syslog because of the semaphore.
	  This option make logread to double buffer copy
	  from circular buffer, minimizing semaphore
	  contention at some minor memory expense.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_KMSG_SYSLOG
	bool "Linux kernel printk buffer support"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_SYSLOGD
	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility will
	  write system log message to the Linux kernel's printk buffer.
	  This can be used as a smaller alternative to the syslogd IPC
	  support, as klogd and logread aren't needed.

	  NOTICE: Syslog facilities in log entries needs kernel 3.5+.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_KLOGD
	bool "klogd"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_AVM_HAS_PRINTK
	help
	  klogd is a utility which intercepts and logs all
	  messages from the Linux kernel and sends the messages
	  out to the 'syslogd' utility so they can be logged. If
	  you wish to record the messages produced by the kernel,
	  you should enable this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_KLOGD_KLOGCTL
	bool "Use the klogctl() interface"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX_KLOGD
	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  The klogd applet supports two interfaces for reading
	  kernel messages. Linux provides the klogctl() interface
	  which allows reading messages from the kernel ring buffer
	  independently from the file system.

	  If you answer 'N' here, klogd will use the more portable
	  approach of reading them from /proc or a device node.
	  However, this method requires the file to be available.

	  If in doubt, say 'Y'.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX_LOGGER
	bool "logger"
	default n
	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	    The logger utility allows you to send arbitrary text
	    messages to the system log (i.e. the 'syslogd' utility) so
	    they can be logged. This is generally used to help locate
	    problems that occur within programs and scripts.
