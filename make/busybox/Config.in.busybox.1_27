config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_DESKTOP
	depends on FREETZ_DISABLE_OPTION_BY_MAKING_IT_DEPEND_ON_NONEXISTING_SYMBOL
	bool "Enable options for full-blown desktop systems"
	default n
	help
	  Enable options and features which are not essential.
	  Select this if you plan to use busybox on full-blown desktop machine
	  with common Linux distro, which needs higher level of command-line
	  compatibility.

	  If you are preparing your build to be used on an embedded box
	  where you have tighter control over the entire set of userspace
	  tools, you can unselect this option for smaller code size.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_EXTRA_COMPAT
	bool "Provide compatible behavior for rare corner cases (bigger code)"
	default n
	help
	  This option makes grep, sed etc handle rare corner cases
	  (embedded NUL bytes and such). This makes code bigger and uses
	  some GNU extensions in libc. You probably only need this option
	  if you plan to run busybox on desktop.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEDORA_COMPAT
	depends on FREETZ_DISABLE_OPTION_BY_MAKING_IT_DEPEND_ON_NONEXISTING_SYMBOL
	bool "Building for Fedora distribution"
	default n
	help
	This option makes some tools behave like they do on Fedora.

	At the time of this writing (2017-08) this only affects uname:
	normally, uname -p (processor) and uname -i (platform)
	are shown as "unknown", but with this option uname -p
	shows the same string as uname -m (machine type),
	and so does uname -i unless machine type is i486/i586/i686 -
	then uname -i shows "i386".

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_INCLUDE_SUSv2
	bool "Enable obsolete features removed before SUSv3"
	default n
	help
	  This option will enable backwards compatibility with SuSv2,
	  specifically, old-style numeric options ('command -1 <file>')
	  will be supported in head, tail, and fold. (Note: should
	  affect renice too.)

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_USE_PORTABLE_CODE
	bool "Avoid using GCC-specific code constructs"
	default n
	help
	  Use this option if you are trying to compile busybox with
	  compiler other than gcc.
	  If you do use gcc, this option may needlessly increase code size.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show applet usage messages"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this option, BusyBox applets will show terse help messages
	  when invoked with wrong arguments.
	  If you do not want to show any (helpful) usage message when
	  issuing wrong command syntax, you can say 'N' here,
	  saving approximately 7k.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show verbose help messages when
	  busybox is invoked with --help. This will add a lot of text to the
	  busybox binary. In the default configuration, this will add about
	  13k, but it can add much more depending on your configuration.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  Store usage messages in .bz compressed form, uncompress them
	  on-the-fly when <applet> --help is called.

	  If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	  bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	  be noticeable. Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	  and have very little memory, this might not be a win. Otherwise,
	  you probably want this.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_BUSYBOX
	bool "Include busybox applet"
	default n
	help
	  The busybox applet provides general help regarding busybox and
	  allows the included applets to be listed.  It's also required
	  if applet links are to be installed at runtime.

	  If you can live without these features disabling this will save
	  some space.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_INSTALLER
	bool "Support --install [-s] to install applet links at runtime"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_BUSYBOX
	help
	  Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support. This will allow you to use
	  busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
	  applets that are compiled into busybox.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_INSTALL_NO_USR
	bool "Don't use /usr"
	default n
	help
	  Disable use of /usr. busybox --install and "make install"
	  will install applets only to /bin and /sbin,
	  never to /usr/bin or /usr/sbin.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_PAM
	bool "Support PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)"
	default n
	help
	  Use PAM in some busybox applets (currently login and httpd) instead
	  of direct access to password database.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_LONG_OPTS
	bool "Support --long-options"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	  style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default n
	help
	  Enable if you want BusyBox to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	  busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	  and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side. Otherwise, BSD style
	  /dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	  devpts mounted.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	bool "Clean up all memory before exiting (usually not needed)"
	default n
	help
	  As a size optimization, busybox normally exits without explicitly
	  freeing dynamically allocated memory or closing files. This saves
	  space since the OS will clean up for us, but it can confuse debuggers
	  like valgrind, which report tons of memory and resource leaks.

	  Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
	  things up manually.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_UTMP
	bool "Support utmp file"
	default n
	help
	  The file /var/run/utmp is used to track who is currently logged in.
	  With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	  will create and delete entries there.
	  "who" applet requires this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_WTMP
	bool "Support wtmp file"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_UTMP
	help
	  The file /var/run/wtmp is used to track when users have logged into
	  and logged out of the system.
	  With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	  will append new entries there.
	  "last" applet requires this option.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	bool "Support writing pidfiles"
	default n
	help
	  This option makes some applets (e.g. crond, syslogd, inetd) write
	  a pidfile at the configured PID_FILE_PATH.  It has no effect
	  on applets which require pidfiles to run.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_PID_FILE_PATH
	string "Path to directory for pidfile"
	default "/var/run"
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	help
	  This is the default path where pidfiles are created.  Applets which
	  allow you to set the pidfile path on the command line will override
	  this value.  The option has no effect on applets that require you to
	  specify a pidfile path.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_SUID
	bool "Support SUID/SGID handling"
	default n
	help
	  With this option you can install the busybox binary belonging
	  to root with the suid bit set, enabling some applets to perform
	  root-level operations even when run by ordinary users
	  (for example, mounting of user mounts in fstab needs this).

	  Busybox will automatically drop privileges for applets
	  that don't need root access.

	  If you are really paranoid and don't want to do this, build two
	  busybox binaries with different applets in them (and the appropriate
	  symlinks pointing to each binary), and only set the suid bit on the
	  one that needs it.

	  The applets which require root rights (need suid bit or
	  to be run by root) and will refuse to execute otherwise:
	  crontab, login, passwd, su, vlock, wall.

	  The applets which will use root rights if they have them
	  (via suid bit, or because run by root), but would try to work
	  without root right nevertheless:
	  findfs, ping[6], traceroute[6], mount.

	  Note that if you DONT select this option, but DO make busybox
	  suid root, ALL applets will run under root, which is a huge
	  security hole (think "cp /some/file /etc/passwd").

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	bool "Runtime SUID/SGID configuration via /etc/busybox.conf"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_SUID
	help
	  Allow the SUID / SGID state of an applet to be determined at runtime
	  by checking /etc/busybox.conf. (This is sort of a poor man's sudo.)
	  The format of this file is as follows:

	  APPLET = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] [USER.GROUP]

	  s: USER or GROUP is allowed to execute APPLET.
	     APPLET will run under USER or GROUP
	     (reagardless of who's running it).
	  S: USER or GROUP is NOT allowed to execute APPLET.
	     APPLET will run under USER or GROUP.
	     This option is not very sensical.
	  x: USER/GROUP/others are allowed to execute APPLET.
	     No UID/GID change will be done when it is run.
	  -: USER/GROUP/others are not allowed to execute APPLET.

	  An example might help:

	  [SUID]
	  su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with
	                  # euid=0/egid=0
	  su = ssx        # exactly the same

	  mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members
	                        # of group disk (but not anyone else)
	                        # and runs with euid=0 (egid is not changed)

	  cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

	  The file has to be owned by user root, group root and has to be
	  writeable only by root:
	        (chown 0.0 /etc/busybox.conf; chmod 600 /etc/busybox.conf)
	  The busybox executable has to be owned by user root, group
	  root and has to be setuid root for this to work:
	        (chown 0.0 /bin/busybox; chmod 4755 /bin/busybox)

	help
	  Enable support for SELinux in applets ls, ps, and id. Also provide
	  the option of compiling in SELinux applets.

	  If you do not have a complete SELinux userland installed, this stuff
	  will not compile.  Specifially, libselinux 1.28 or better is
	  directly required by busybox. If the installation is located in a
	  non-standard directory, provide it by invoking make as follows:
		CFLAGS=-I<libselinux-include-path> \
		LDFLAGS=-L<libselinux-lib-path> \
		make

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX__NOEXEC_NOFORK_OPTIMIZATIONS
	bool "exec prefers applets"
	default n
	help
	  This is an experimental option which directs applets about to
	  call 'exec' to try and find an applicable busybox applet before
	  searching the PATH. This is typically done by exec'ing
	  /proc/self/exe.
	  This may affect shell, find -exec, xargs and similar applets.
	  They will use applets even if /bin/<applet> -> busybox link
	  is missing (or is not a link to busybox). However, this causes
	  problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc and with ps/top
	  (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets started this way).

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	string "Path to BusyBox executable"
	default "/proc/self/exe"
	help
	  When Busybox applets need to run other busybox applets, BusyBox
	  sometimes needs to exec() itself. When the /proc filesystem is
	  mounted, /proc/self/exe always points to the currently running
	  executable. If you haven't got /proc, set this to wherever you
	  want to run BusyBox from.

	default n
	help
	  If you want to build a static BusyBox binary, which does not
	  use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
	  This can cause BusyBox to be considerably larger, so you should
	  leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.

	help
	  Using an additional debugging library will make BusyBox become
	  considerable larger and will cause it to run more slowly. You
	  should always leave this option disabled for production use.

	  dmalloc support:
	  ----------------
	  This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	  which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	  detector. To enable dmalloc, before running busybox you will
	  want to properly set your environment, for example:
	    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	  The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command
	    dmalloc -p log-stats -p log-non-free -p log-bad-space \
	       -p log-elapsed-time -p check-fence -p check-heap \
	       -p check-lists -p check-blank -p check-funcs -p realloc-copy \
	       -p allow-free-null

	  Electric-fence support:
	  -----------------------
	  This enables compiling with Electric-fence support. Electric
	  fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	  your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	  accesses. This support will make BusyBox be considerable larger
	  and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	  you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.

	default n
	help
	  Attempt to reclaim a small unused part of BSS.

	  Executables have the following parts:
	  = read-only executable code and constants, also known as "text"
	  = read-write data
	  = non-initialized (zeroed on demand) data, also known as "bss"

	  At link time, "text" is padded to a full page. At runtime, all "text"
	  pages are mapped RO and executable.
	  "Data" starts on the next page boundary, but is not padded
	  to a full page at the end. "Bss" starts wherever "data" ends.
	  At runtime, "data" pages are mapped RW and they are file-backed
	  (this includes a small portion of "bss" which may live in the last
	  partial page of "data").
	  Pages which are fully in "bss" are mapped to anonymous memory.

	  "Bss" end is usually not page-aligned. There is an unused space
	  in the last page. Linker marks its start with the "_end" symbol.

	  This option will attempt to use that space for bb_common_bufsiz1[]
	  array. If it fits after _end, it will be used, and COMMON_BUFSIZE
	  will be enlarged from its guaranteed minimum size of 1 kbyte.
	  This may require recompilation a second time, since value of _end
	  is known only after final link.

	  If you are getting a build error like this:

	  Any character with Unicode value bigger than this is assumed

	  mount table, such as df, will skip rootfs entry.

	  However, some systems do not mount anything on /.
	  If you need to configure busybox for one of these systems,

	  Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted

	  the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	  the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	  a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	  The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	  your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	  If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	  example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	  features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	  that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	  by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	  that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	  About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	  your kernel.

		  $ ls -ld /dev/pts
		  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Sep 23 13:21 /dev/pts/

	  Next you need the pseudo terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx:

		  $ ls -la /dev/ptmx
		  crw-rw-rw-  1 root tty 5, 2 Sep 23 13:55 /dev/ptmx

	  Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.
	  Next, you need to mount the devpts filesystem on /dev/pts using:

		  mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

	  You need to be sure that busybox has LOGIN and
	  FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_SUID enabled. And finally, you should make
	  certain that Busybox has been installed setuid root:

		chown root.root /bin/busybox

	  wget will use internal TLS code to connect to https:// URLs.
	  Note:
	  On NOMMU machines, ssl_helper applet should be available
	  in the $PATH for this to work. Make sure to select that applet.

	  Note: currently, TLS code only makes TLS I/O work, it
	  does *not* check that the peer is who it claims to be, etc.
	  IOW: it uses peer-supplied public keys to establish encryption
	  and signing keys, then encrypts and signs outgoing data and
	  decrypts incoming data.
	  It does not check signature hashes on the incoming data:
	  this means that attackers manipulating TCP packets can
	  send altered data and we unknowingly receive garbage.
	  (This check might be relatively easy to add).
	  It does not check public key's certificate:
	  this means that the peer may be an attacker impersonating
	  the server we think we are talking to.

	  If you think this is unacceptable, consider this. As more and more
	  servers switch to HTTPS-only operation, without such "crippled"
	  TLS code it is *impossible* to simply download a kernel source
	  from kernel.org. Which can in real world translate into
	  "my small automatic tooling to build cross-compilers from sources
	  no longer works, I need to additionally keep a local copy
	  of ~4 megabyte source tarball of a SSL library and ~2 megabyte
	  source of wget, need to compile and built both before I can
	  download anything. All this despite the fact that the build
	  is done in a QEMU sandbox on a machine with absolutely nothing
	  worth stealing, so I don't care if someone would go to a lot
	  of trouble to intercept my HTTPS download to send me an altered
	  kernel tarball".

	  If you still think this is unacceptable, send patches.

	  If you still think this is unacceptable, do not want to send
	  patches, but do want to waste bandwidth expaining how wrong
	  it is, you will be ignored.

	  Try to use openssl to handle HTTPS.

	  OpenSSL has a simple SSL client for debug purposes.
	  If you select this option, wget will effectively run:
	  "openssl s_client -quiet -connect hostname:443
	  -servername hostname 2>/dev/null" and pipe its data
	  through it. -servername is not used if hostname is numeric.
	  Note inconvenient API: host resolution is done twice,
	  and there is no guarantee openssl's idea of IPv6 address
	  format is the same as ours.
	  Another problem is that s_client prints debug information
	  to stderr, and it needs to be suppressed. This means
	  all error messages get suppressed too.
	  openssl is also a big binary, often dynamically linked
	  against ~15 libraries.

	  If openssl can't be executed, internal TLS code will be used
	  (if you enabled it); if openssl can be executed but fails later,
	  wget can't detect this, and download will fail.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_CTTYHACK
	bool "cttyhack"
	default n
	help
	  One common problem reported on the mailing list is the "can't
	  access tty; job control turned off" error message, which typically
	  appears when one tries to use a shell with stdin/stdout on
	  /dev/console.
	  This device is special - it cannot be a controlling tty.

	  The proper solution is to use the correct device instead of
	  /dev/console.

	  cttyhack provides a "quick and dirty" solution to this problem.
	  It analyzes stdin with various ioctls, trying to determine whether
	  it is a /dev/ttyN or /dev/ttySN (virtual terminal or serial line).
	  On Linux it also checks sysfs for a pointer to the active console.
	  If cttyhack is able to find the real console device, it closes
	  stdin/out/err and reopens that device.
	  Then it executes the given program. Opening the device will make
	  that device a controlling tty. This may require cttyhack
	  to be a session leader.

	  Example for /etc/inittab (for busybox init):

	  ::respawn:/bin/cttyhack /bin/sh

	  Starting an interactive shell from boot shell script:

	  setsid cttyhack sh

	  Giving controlling tty to shell running with PID 1:

	  # exec cttyhack sh

	  Without cttyhack, you need to know exact tty name,
	  and do something like this:

	  # exec setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1'

	  Starting getty on a controlling tty from a shell script:

	  # getty 115200 $(cttyhack)

	  This option causes busybox shells to use busybox applets
	  in preference to executables in the PATH whenever possible. For
	  example, entering the command 'ifconfig' into the shell would cause
	  busybox to use the ifconfig busybox applet. Specifying the fully
	  qualified executable name, such as '/sbin/ifconfig' will still
	  execute the /sbin/ifconfig executable on the filesystem. This option
	  is generally used when creating a statically linked version of busybox
	  for use as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your system.

	  This is implemented by re-execing /proc/self/exe (typically)
	  with right parameters.

	  However, there are drawbacks: it is problematic in chroot jails
	  without mounted /proc, and ps/top may show command name as 'exe'
	  for applets started this way.

	  This option causes busybox shells to not execute typical

	  This will be done only for some applets (those which are marked

	  klogd is a utility which intercepts and logs all
	  messages from the Linux kernel and sends the messages
	  out to the 'syslogd' utility so they can be logged. If
	  you wish to record the messages produced by the kernel,
	  you should enable this option.

	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  The klogd applet supports two interfaces for reading
	  kernel messages. Linux provides the klogctl() interface
	  which allows reading messages from the kernel ring buffer
	  independently from the file system.

	  If you answer 'N' here, klogd will use the more portable
	  approach of reading them from /proc or a device node.
	  However, this method requires the file to be available.

	  If in doubt, say 'Y'.
config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_LOGGER
	bool "logger"
	default n
	select FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	    The logger utility allows you to send arbitrary text
	    messages to the system log (i.e. the 'syslogd' utility) so
	    they can be logged. This is generally used to help locate
	    problems that occur within programs and scripts.
config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_LOGREAD
	bool "logread"
	default n
	help
	  If you enabled Circular Buffer support, you almost
	  certainly want to enable this feature as well. This
	  utility will allow you to read the messages that are
	  stored in the syslogd circular buffer.

	bool "Double buffering"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_LOGREAD
	help
	  'logread' output to slow serial terminals can have
	  side effects on syslog because of the semaphore.
	  This option make logread to double buffer copy
	  from circular buffer, minimizing semaphore
	  contention at some minor memory expense.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_SYSLOGD
	bool "syslogd"
	default n
	help
	  The syslogd utility is used to record logs of all the
	  significant events that occur on a system. Every
	  message that is logged records the date and time of the
	  event, and will generally also record the name of the
	  application that generated the message. When used in
	  conjunction with klogd, messages from the Linux kernel
	  can also be recorded. This is terribly useful,
	  especially for finding what happened when something goes
	  wrong. And something almost always will go wrong if
	  you wait long enough....

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_ROTATE_LOGFILE
	bool "Rotate message files"

	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_SYSLOGD
	help
	  When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility can
	  be used to send system log messages to another system
	  connected via a network. This allows the remote
	  machine to log all the system messages, which can be
	  terribly useful for reducing the number of serial
	  cables you use. It can also be a very good security
	  measure to prevent system logs from being tampered with
	  by an intruder.

	bool "Circular Buffer support"
	default n
	depends on FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_SYSLOGD
	help
	  When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility will
	  use a circular buffer to record system log messages.
	  When the buffer is filled it will continue to overwrite
	  the oldest messages. This can be very useful for
	  systems with little or no permanent storage, since
	  otherwise system logs can eventually fill up your
	  entire filesystem, which may cause your system to
	  break badly.

config FREETZ_BUSYBOX___V127_FEATURE_IPC_SYSLOG_BUFFER_SIZE

	help
	  When you enable this feature, the syslogd utility will
	  write system log message to the Linux kernel's printk buffer.
	  This can be used as a smaller alternative to the syslogd IPC
	  support, as klogd and logread aren't needed.

	  NOTICE: Syslog facilities in log entries needs kernel 3.5+.
