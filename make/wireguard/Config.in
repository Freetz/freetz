		WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN
		that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be
		faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while
		avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably
		more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a
		general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
		super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.
		Initially released for the Linux kernel, it plans to be
		cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently under
		heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the
		most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in
		the industry.
