		GNU GPL'd Pico clone with more functionality.

		GNU nano is a small and friendly text editor. Besides basic text
		editing, nano offers many extra features like an interactive search
		and replace, go to line and column number, auto-indentation, feature
		toggles and filename tab completion.

		The original goal for nano was a complete bug-for-bug compatible
		emulation of Pico, but nano's current goal is to be as compatible as
		possible while offering a superset of Pico's functionality.

		IMPORTANT NOTES:

		1.) Selecting any option besides "Tiny binary" will make the nano binary
		bigger. The range is somewhere between 142 KB and 249 KB, depending on
		the options chosen.

		2.) Please also be aware of the fact that changing any feature options
		results in an automatic rebuild of the package - just in case you were
		wondering.

		3.) Note that UTF8 support and spell checking is disabled by default.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_UTF8
		bool "With UTF8 support"
		select FREETZ_LIB_libncursesw
		default y
		help
			Use ncursesw for UTF8 support.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		bool "Tiny binary"
		default y
		help
			Strip whichever feature possible from the Nano binary and keep
			everything small and simple, yet powerful and easy to use.

			With this option enabled as the only one, Nano's binary has an
			approximate size of 142 KB. NOTE that deselecting this option
			already results in a 182 KB binary in size although no other
			option has been selected. This is because nano compiler option
			"--enable-tiny" also disables some larger internals like
			marking and cutting to the end of a line.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_HELP
		bool "Online help"
		depends on ! FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		select FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_MULTIBUFFER
		default n
		help
			Show a list of available keyboard commands via Ctrl-G or F1. As the
			name suggests, this is quite helpful. ;-)

			This option adds about 8.4 KB to the minimum 182 KB of Nano's non-tiny binary.

			If you are unfamiliar with Nano and Pico and have some space left
			in the firmware image, you are recommended choosing this option anyway.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TABCOMP
		bool "Tab completion for file names"
		depends on ! FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		default n
		help
			When opening or saving files, you get tab completion for directory and
			file names. Even with the file browser switched off, this is a
			powerful tool to help you save time when typing in path names.

			This option adds about 4.7 KB to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_BROWSER
		bool "File browser"
		depends on ! FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		default n
		help
			Browse the directory structure in a multi-line area showing
			directories and files between which you can navigate with the
			keyboard. The Browser is invoked by pressing ^T when entering
			a file name to open/write.

			This option adds about 9.7 KB to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_OPERATINGDIR
		bool "Set operating directory"
		depends on ! FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		default n
		help
			Set operating directory. Makes Nano set up something
			similar to a chroot by using the '-o' command line option.

			This option adds almost nothing to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_JUSTIFY
		bool "Justify/unjustify functions"
		depends on ! FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		default n
		help
			Support for (un-)justifying paragraphs of text, e.g. program code.

			This option adds about 9.4 KB to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_WRAPPING
		depends on ! FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_TINY
		bool "Long line wrapping"
		default n
		help
			Enable long line wrapping. This also creates the -w command line
			option which enables long line wrapping.

			This option adds about 4.4 KB to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_WRAPPING_ROOT
		depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_WRAPPING
		bool "Disable long line wrapping for root"
		default n
		help
			Disable long line wrapping feature if nano is run as root.

			This option adds almost nothing to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_MULTIBUFFER
		bool "Multiple file buffers"
		default n
		help
			Edit multiple files at once and cycle through the different buffers
			via simple keyboard commands.

			This option adds about 4.4 KB to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_MOUSE_CONTROL
		bool "Mouse control"
		default n
		help
			Nano has its own built-in mouse services, but they are limited.
			They provide only the ability to move the cursor to the point
			where you click, and to mark the beginning and end of a section
			of text. Use the Alt-M key combination to toggle between using
			the terminal's mouse services and nano's built-in mouse services.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_NANORC
		bool "Nanorc startup file support"
		default n
		help
			Enable support for reading the nanorc file at startup. You can store
			custom settings in the nanorc file rather than having to pass command
			line options to get desired behavior.

			This option adds about 9.6 KB to the minimum 182 KB
			of Nano's non-tiny binary.

			NOTE: A nanorc file with editing support is added to your firmware.

	config FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_COLOR_SYNTAX
		bool "Coloured syntax highlighting support"
		default n
		select FREETZ_PACKAGE_NANO_NANORC
		help
			Enable support for syntax coloring of files using the nanorc file.
			This enables nanorc support, but does NOT automatically copy any
			syntax files to the target system.

			This option adds about 21.4 KB plus possibly a few KB of your
			syntax files to the minimum 182 KB of Nano's non-tiny binary,
			including nanorc support.

			IMPORTANT NOTES:

			If you want to include any syntax definition files by yourself
			(look for *.nanorc in the nano source package (doc/systax), define
			or download your own files), you are advised to copy them into
			make/nano/files/root/usr/share/nano/ before compiling Freetz.
			This way your snytax files are enabled automatically when saving
			your customized nanorc via WebIf or on startup.

			You can select some of nano's default syntax highlighting files
			to be integrated into the firmware image by the "Nano syntax
			highlighting files" menu below (visible if this option is selected).
			Files selected in the menu are also enabled automatically.
