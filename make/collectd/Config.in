		Collectd collects information about the system it is running on and 
		stores this information. The information can then be used to do find
		current performance bottlenecks (i. e. performance analysis) and
		predict future system load (i. e. capacity planning). Or if you just 
		want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some
		homegrown solution you're at the right place, too.
