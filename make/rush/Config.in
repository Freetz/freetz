		GNU Rush is a Restricted User Shell, designed
		for sites providing limited remote access to
		their resources, such as, for example,
		savannah.gnu.org. Its main program, rush, is
		configured as a user login shell for users
		that are allowed only remote access to the
		machine. Using a flexible configuration file,
		GNU Rush gives administrator complete control
		over the command lines that users execute,
		and allows to tune the usage of system
		resources, such as virtual memory,
		CPU time, etc. on a per-user basis.
