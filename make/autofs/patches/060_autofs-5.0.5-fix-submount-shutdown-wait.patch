autofs-5.0.5 - fix submount shutdown wait

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

When expiring a mount that has submounts we determine if a submount is
still in use by its state being other than ST_SHUTDOWN. But a submount
that is in the process of exiting could also be in one of the states
ST_SHUTDOWN_PENDING or ST_SHUTDOWN_FORCE, in which case we should also
continue to wait for the submount entry to be removed from the list or
for it to reach another state.
