+If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate Authority
+certificate must be set within the LDAP client configuration in 
+order to validate the server certificate. If, in addition, a certified
+connection is to be used then the client certificate and private key file
+locations must also be configured within the LDAP client.
+.SH "OPTIONS"
+This files contains a single XML element, as shown in the example above, with
+several attributes.
+.TP
+The possible attributes are:
+.TP
+\fBusetls="yes"|"no"\fP
+Determines whether an encrypted connection to the ldap server
+should be attempted.
+.TP
+\fBtlsrequired="yes"|"no"\fP
+This flag tells whether the ldap connection must be encrypted. If set to "yes",
+the automounter will fail to start if an encrypted connection cannot be
+established.
+.TP
+\fBauthrequired="yes"|"no"|"autodetect"|"simple"\fP
+This option tells whether an authenticated connection to the ldap server is
+required in order to perform ldap queries. If the flag is set to yes, only
+sasl authenticated connections will be allowed. If it is set to no then
+authentication is not needed for ldap server connections. If it is set to
+autodetect then the ldap server will be queried to establish a suitable sasl
+authentication  mechanism. If no suitable mechanism can be found, connections
+to the ldap server are made without authentication. Finally, if it is set to
+simple, then simple authentication will be used instead of SASL.
+.TP
+\fBauthtype="GSSAPI"|"LOGIN"|"PLAIN"|"ANONYMOUS"|"DIGEST-MD5"\fP
+This attribute can be used to specify a preferred authentication mechanism.
+ In normal operations, the automounter will attempt to authenticate to the
+ldap server using the list of supportedSASLmechanisms obtained from the
+directory server.  Explicitly setting the authtype will bypass this selection
+and only try the mechanism specified.
+.TP
+\fBuser="<username>"\fP
+This attribute holds the authentication identity used by authentication
+mechanisms that require it.  Legal values for this attribute include any
+printable characters that can be used by the selected authentication
+mechanism.
+.TP
+\fBsecret="<password>"\fP
+This attribute holds the secret used by authentication mechanisms that
+require it. Legal values for this attribute include any printable
+characters that can be used by the selected authentication mechanism.
+.TP
+\fBclientprinc="<GSSAPI client principal>"\fP
+When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute is consulted to determine
+the principal name to use when authenticating to the directory server. By
+default, this will be set to "autofsclient/<fqdn>@<REALM>.
+.TP
+\fBcredentialcache="<external credential cache path>"\fP
+When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute can be used to specify an
+externally configured credential cache that is used during authentication.
+By default, autofs will setup a memory based credential cache.
