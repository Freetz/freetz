autofs-5.0.5 - make nfs4 default for RedHat replicated selection configuration

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

We know for sure that RHEL-6 and later is set to mount NFSv4 as default and
fall back to earlier NFS versions if it can't mount as NFSv4. So set our
default for replicated mount probing to start at NFSv4 instead of v3.
