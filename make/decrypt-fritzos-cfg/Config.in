		This package provides a script making it possible to decrypt
		encrypted parts (usually credentials) of FRITZ!OS configuration
		files. See http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=276183
		for usage details.

		NO RESPONSIBILITY DISCLAIMER:
		  Adding easy callable scripts like this providing password
		  decryption capabilities decreases the SECURITY of your box.
		  Use it on YOUR OWN RISK, Freetz is not responsible
		  for any potential losses or damages resulting/arising
		  from adding this script to your firmware.

		Note for boxes without WebDAV support:
		  This packages requires AVM binary webdavcfginfo (including
		  its dependencies) to be available in your firmware image.
		  Please copy all required files manually if the original
		  firmware for your box doesn't contain them. A firmware
		  image for some other box with the same kernel layout and
		  of the same FRITZ!OS version might be a good source, i.e.
		    7312       <- 7330  (webdavcfginfo, libusbcfg.so*)
		    6810, 7412 <- 7490  (webdavcfginfo, libusbcfg.so*)

		  Instead of copying webdavcfginfo and its dependencies
		  from the firmware of the other box you might just copy
		  the allcfginfo binary from an older firmware version
		  for your box. You don't necessarily need to overwrite
		  the original allcfginfo, you might also save it as
		  allcfginfo-c. Callmonitor package will automatically
		  detect and use it.
