		With a patched kernel and this tool it is possible to
		configure the ADM6996L switch (at least FB 7170, maybe
		other FBs with 4 LAN ports work too) to support VLANs
		and/or to split the LAN ports into different subnets.
		It is also possible to view or set each ports power
		configuration and to disable auto media detection and
		to force a given media type for each port (10/100 Mbit,
		Half-/Full-Duplex). Some features are only available
		when Replace Kernel is selected.
		Since version 0.6 cpmaccfg detects the tantos switches
		used i.e. in F!B 7270. However, since there is not
		enough documentation (freely) available yet, it is not
		yet possible to configure this chipset.
