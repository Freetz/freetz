Subject: libc: fix daylight saving time handling

The algorithm computing daylight saving time incorrectly adds a day for
each month after January for leap years. The clock shift from/to DST can
be delayed if the last Sunday of a transition month is exactly seven
days before the first of the following month.

This change adds a day for the February month only.
