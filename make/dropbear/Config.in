		Dropbear SSH server and client

		Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs on a
		variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software,
		distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly useful
		for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as wireless
		routers.

		Features
		  - A small memory footprint suitable for memory-constrained
		    environments - Dropbear can compile to a 110kB statically linked
		    binary with uClibc on x86 (only minimal options selected)
		  - Dropbear server implements X11 forwarding, and authentication-agent
		    forwarding for OpenSSH clients
		  - Can run from inetd or standalone
		  - Compatible with OpenSSH ~/.ssh/authorized_keys public key
		    authentication
		  - The server, client, keygen, and key converter can be compiled into a
		    single binary (a la busybox)
		  - Features can easily be disabled when compiling to save space
		    TCP forwarding support

		With this option, a connection between the client and
		the server is established faster.

		Without this option selected, the ssh server performs a DNS
		reverse lookup of the client's IP address.

	help
		With this option enabled, the resulting binary will be independ from libraries.
		Usually used to build a binary for boxes without "freetz".
		Newer firmwares (using uClibc >= 0.9.30) should work with dynamically linked
		binary, if "non-freetz" is selected.

		With this option enabled, the resulting binary should also work
		on non freetz boxes.
		(Fix for missing devfs and changes to default paths)
		Will select "static" on firmwares not supporting dynamically linked freetz binaries.
