			unbound - Unbound DNS validating resolver
			
			It  uses a built in list of authoritative nameservers for the root zone
			(.), the so called root hints.  On receiving a DNS query  it  will  ask
			the root nameservers for an answer and will in almost all cases receive
			a delegation to a top level domain (TLD) authoritative nameserver.   It
			will  then ask that nameserver for an answer.  It will recursively con-
			tinue until an answer is found or no answer  is  available  (NXDOMAIN).
			For performance and efficiency reasons that answer is cached for a cer-
			tain time (the answer's time-to-live or TTL).  A second query  for  the
			same  name  will  then be answered from the cache.  Unbound can also do
			DNSSEC validation.

			Unbound-anchor performs setup or update of the root trust anchor for
			DNSSEC validation. The program fetches the trust anchor with the
			method from RFC7958 when regular RFC5011 update fails to bring it up to
			date. It can be run (as root) from the commandline, or run as part of
			startup scripts. Before you start the unbound DNS server.

			status: secure, insecure, bogus (security failure).
			
			By default it reads no configuration file whatsoever. It attempts to
			reach the internet root servers. With -C an unbound config file and
			with -r resolv.conf can be read.
