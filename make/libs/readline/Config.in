		The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
		that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs
		and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes
		additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command
		lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like
		history expansion on previous commands.
