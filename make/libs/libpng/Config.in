		libpng is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost all PNG
		features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for over 12
		years. The home site for development versions (i.e., may be buggy or
		subject to change or include experimental features) is
		http://libpng.sourceforge.net/, and the place to go for questions about
		the library is the png-mng-implement mailing list.
