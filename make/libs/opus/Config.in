		Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.
		It is primarily designed for interactive speech and music transmission
		over the Internet, but is also applicable to storage and streaming
		applications. It incorporates technology from Skype's SILK codec and
		Xiph.Org's CELT codec. It has been standardized by the Internet
		Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716.
