		libffi is a library that really only provides the lowest, machine
		dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface. A layer
		must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
		between the two languages. ffi stands for Foreign Function Interface.
		A foreign function interface is the popular name for the interface that
		allows code written in one language to call code written in another
		language.
