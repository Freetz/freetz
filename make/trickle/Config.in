		trickle is a simple and portable lightweight userspace bandwidth
		shaper, to rate limit the TCP connections of a given process or
		group of processes. It can run in collaborative mode (together with
		trickled) or in stand alone mode. trickle works by taking
		advantage of the unix loader preloading. Essentially it
		provides to the application, a new version of the functionality
		that is required to send and receive data through sockets. It
		then limits traffic based on delaying the sending and receiving
		of data over a socket. trickle runs entirely in userspace and does
		not require root privileges.
		*** Does NOT support statically linked executables!!
