		jq is a command-line JSON processor.

		Because all files together need some room in the image
		file (600-800 KB uncompressed), it's possible to move
		them to an 'external' image, if it's activated at all.

	help
		Support for regular expressions adds 358 KB uncompressed
		(about 105 KB compressed) to the final image (in the
		binary and/or a shared library).
		You may omit RE support here, if you'll not need it.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_JQ_STATIC
	bool "Build static binary"

	default n
	help
		The resulting binary takes ~800 KB (~250 KB compressed)
		on a MIPS-based architecture (-march=34kc).
