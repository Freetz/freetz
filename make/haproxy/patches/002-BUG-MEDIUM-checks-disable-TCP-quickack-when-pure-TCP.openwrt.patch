Subject: [PATCH 2/2] BUG/MEDIUM: checks: disable TCP quickack when pure TCP
 checks are used
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Cyril Bonté reported an issue with some services when pure port probes are
used since 1.4.23, because of the RST which is sent and sometimes caught by
the checked service. The result is that the service detects an error and may
sometimes log this error or complain about it. This issue does not appear
when "option tcp-smart-connect" is set.

So we now perform exactly like 1.5 with port probes, which means that we set
the TCP quickack mode on the socket before connecting, so that the final ACK
is never sent. So the sequence is now a clean SYN-SYN/ACK-RST which never
wakes the application up and that only checks that the port is open.
