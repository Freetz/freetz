		ISC DHCP is open source software that implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
		for connection to an IP network. It is production-grade software that offers a complete
		solution for implementing DHCP servers, relay agents, and clients for small local networks
		to large enterprises. ISC DHCP solution supports both IPv4 and IPv6, and is suitable
		for use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.

		Note: if you are using dnsmasq: to avoid conflict you can do any of:
		- pass -p <otherport> to isc-dhcp 
		- pass --dhcp-alternate-port to dnsmasq
		- disable dhcp for dnsmasq by removing the dhcp-range setting
