		NcFTP is a free program that use the File Transfer Protocol.
		The purpose of ncftp is to provide a powerful and flexible
		interface to the Internet standard File Transfer Protocol.
		Although the program appears to be rather spartan, you'll
		find that ncftp has a wealth of valuable performance and
		usage features. The program was designed with an emphasis
		on usability, and it does as much as it can for you
		automatically so you can do what you expect to do with a
		file transfer program, which is transfer files between two
		interconnected systems.
