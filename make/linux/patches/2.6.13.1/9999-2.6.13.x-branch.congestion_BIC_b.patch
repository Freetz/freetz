Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] tcp: BIC max increment too large

The max growth of BIC TCP is too large. Original code was based on
BIC 1.0 and the default there was 32. Later code (2.6.13) included
compensation for delayed acks, and should have reduced the default
value to 16; since normally TCP gets one ack for every two packets sent.

The current value of 32 makes BIC too aggressive and unfair to other
flows.
