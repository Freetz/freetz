		Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
		terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells.

		Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal
		and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64
		(ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support
		for multiple character sets).

		There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a
		copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions
		between windows.

		When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it
		(or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can
		use the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can create
		new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more
		shells), kill the current window, view a list of the active windows,
		turn output logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the
		scrollback history, switch between windows, etc.

		All windows run their programs completely independent of each other.
		Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible and
		even when the whole screen session is detached from the users terminal.
