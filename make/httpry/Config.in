		httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying
		and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis
		itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later
		analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as
		it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file.
		It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so
		that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.
