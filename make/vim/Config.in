			Select your vim flavour here.

			tiny = simple (v) improved editing functionality.
			normal = simple (v) improved editing functionality + colors + folding
			huge = simple (v) improved editing functionality + colors + folding + scripts + plugins

			This option only makes the executable larger,
			it does not copy the runtime files. Those would not fit on your box either.
			It's up to you to get it to /usr/share/vim, eg. bind mounts.
