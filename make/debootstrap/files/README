How to build or update this package

The original version of this package consisted of a multi-stage build script
which first extracted and modified a Debian udeb package and then injected a
self-built binary. We decided to refrain from having a "Debian to Freetz
converter" in our build script in order to get a cleaner makefile
(debootstrap.mk) which only builds a binary and injects it into a prepared
package, as usual in Freetz. If you want to update the package, please read
the following description:

- Download debootstrap sources and Debian udeb package of the same version
  (1.0.10 at the time of writing this)
- Extract data.tar.gz (using 'ar' utility) from Debian udeb package
- Extract data.tar.gz to package/debootstrap-<version>/root
- Remove unwanted or unneeded scripts from extracted file structure (e.g.
  usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/{breezy,hoary,warty,woody}
- Apply patches, if necessary (see below for a patch used in 1.0.10)
- Compile 'pkgdetails' binary using Freetz makefile. The binary can be
  found in old debian 'debootstrap' source or in newer 'baseinstaller'
  source packages. At the time of writing this, the debootstrap version
  0.3.3.2etch1 is sufficient.
