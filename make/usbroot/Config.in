		Mount an ext{2,3} filesystem (fs) from an USB stick and use it
		as root fs which may be fully writable and basically unlimited
		in size. The Linux kernel will still be loaded from your box
		and during the first phase of the init process the SquashFS on
		the box is still used, but after the USB root is mounted, we
		pivot_root into it and it becomes the new root fs. The default
		is to unmount the read-only fs on the box to conserve memory,
		but if desired, it can be still be accessed under /oldroot
		(though this is absolutely not necessary anymore after
		pivot_root).

		Having said that, it should be clear that the usb stick	should
		contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just
		create a full copy of a target filesystem (e.g. from
		build/modified/filesystem or from an unpacked firmware image)
		and start modifying it as needed. The binaries (kernel modules,
		executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit
		the kernel installed on the box.

		Note: The webinterface makes it pretty easy to (de-)activate and
		configure the functionality of this package. However, USB root
		is an expert thing! See also the help screen of
		/etc/init.d/rc.usbroot for further description. As some config
		data is stored in bootloader environment, this package is
		special anyway.
