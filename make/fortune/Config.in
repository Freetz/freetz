		Fortune is a small game that is meant to lighten up your life.
		It can be used to display a random entry from a cookie file.

		After having installed the package, just put some fortune-
		files into a directory and create a symbolic link to
		/var/media/fortunes like this:
		ln -s /var/media/ftp/ExternalDisk/fortunes/ /var/media/fortunes

		For your convenience I have packed some fortune-files up and
		uploaded them here:
		http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~pkrueger/fortunes.7z

		If you'd rather get your own files, you could start looking here:
