		Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a free Unix kernel module that allows
		non-privileged users to create their own file systems without the need
		to write any kernel code. This is achieved by running the file
		systemcode in user space, while the FUSE module only provides a "bridge"
		to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE was officially merged into the
		mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14.

		FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike
		traditional filesystems which essentially save data to and retrieve data
		from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves.
		They act as a view or translation of an existing filesystem or storage
		device. In principle, any resource available to FUSE implementation can
		be exported as a file system.

		In Freetz, the NTFS package depends on fuse, for example.
