# Welcome to Freetz

This read-me file is just a stub. The Freetz project is currently in the process of migrating
the web site Freetz.org to GitHub and the SVN repository to the already existing GitHub repo
you have just found here.

For more information about Freetz please read the [wiki](https://freetz.github.io/)
(backup copy of the original Trac wiki hosted on Freetz.org).
