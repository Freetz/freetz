		help
			In 99,9% of all cases you want this option deactivated because usually
			it makes a lot of sense to unpack a firmware before modifying it. ;-)

			Keep this enabled to check the signature of the image
			file with AVM's device specific public key.
			Some very old devices have no signed firmware yet.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_MODIFY
		bool "Skip modifying unpacked firmware, adding Freetz stuff"
		default n
		help
			Usually you want this option deactivated, but maybe you want to use
			the Freetz build infrastructure to build your own custom firmware mod
			without actually adding any Freetz-specific stuff. If so, activate
			this option.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_PACK
		bool "Skip packing modified firmware"
		default n
		help
			If you are a USB root or NFS root user, you probably do not need a
			packed firmware image for flashing. It might not fit into the box's
			flash memory anyway if you have chosen a lot of packages. In that
			case you want to activate this option.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_SIGN
		bool "Sign image file"
		depends on FREETZ_AVM_HAS_SIGNATURE && ! FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_PACK
		default y
		help
			The firmware image will be signed with a self created key.
			It can only be flashed by bootloader or with Freetz.
			In case the installed firmware contains already your public
			signature key, you could also flash it by AVM web interface.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_SIGN_PASSWORD
		string "Password of the private key to sign the image"
		depends on FREETZ_FWMOD_SIGN
		default "freetz"
		help
			A password has to be set and needs at least 6 characters.
			If you have forgotten the password, you could delete the
			~/.freetz-signature/ directory to create a new key file set.

			As ~/.freetz-signature/ is used by all you Freetz checkouts,
			you need to use for all the same password! Or you link/create
			./signature directory by yourself

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_FORCE_PACK
		bool "Force pack even if image is too big (SDK stick mode)"
		depends on ! FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_PACK
		default n
		help
			Choose this option if you intend to use the packed image on an SDK
			stick (see http://web.archive.org/20200701000000/wehavemorefun.de/fritzbox/SDK-Firmware).
			At the time of writing this, SDK stick mode is only supported on
			7270_v2/3, but maybe you found a way to port it to another firmware,
			so you are free to use this option at will.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_BUGGY_FLASH_COMPAT
		bool "Compatibility for forks with buggy flash"
		depends on ! FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_PACK
		default n
		help
			Some Freetz forks have a buggy flash method. If you have
			installed such one, you can not flash images by AVM or
			modified with Freetz-NG.
			Enable this option to be compatible and allow to flash
			Freetz-NG for the 1st time.
			If you plan to flash by the bootloader, this option isn't needed.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_CREATE_IN_MEMORY_IMAGE
		bool "Create in-memory image file"

			Creates a so-called in-memory or ram image suitable to be loaded
			into the box memory by bootloader and used to boot and flash the
			box from there.

			On NAND devices this procedure (booting from the in-memory image)
			corresponds to a regular recovery process. Every image (original
			and a modified one) automatically detects the location it has been
			started from: 1) flash memory partitions, or 2) box memory (RAM).
			In the 2nd case instead of just running the image as in the 1st one
			it flashes itself into the flash memory partitions marked as being
			active (linux_fs_start urlader variable).

			Flash by the bootloader does no signature checks and that's why this
			method should be used for modifying a Fritz!Box for the first time.

			The required flash scripts and a detailled description could be
			found in the 'eva_tools' directory of the YourFritz repository:
			 https://github.com/PeterPawn/YourFritz/tree/master/eva_tools

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_USBROOT
		bool "Pack file system into archive (USB root mode)"
		default n
		help
			Choose this option if you intend to use the modified file system as a
			USB root and want it packed into a .tar.gz archive for later transfer
			to the USB medium.

			This option can also be useful for NFS root, if you want to archive
			the file system in addition to or instead of copying it to a target
			directory directly using the next option.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_NFSROOT
		bool "Copy file system to target folder (NFS root mode)"
		default n
		select FREETZ_FWMOD_USBROOT
		help
			Choose this option if you intend to use the modified file system as
			an NFS root and want it copied to a target folder of your choice.

			This option can also be useful for USB root, if the target USB medium
			is already attached to your workstation or accessible via NFS (*not*
			Samba/CIFS!).

			ATTENTION: Make sure that the target folder is *not* mounted as a
			USB/NFS root while copying files into it. This would probably cause
			your box to reboot and lead to an inconsistent root file system.
			You should also be aware of the fact that in order to cleanly unpack
			file root system to the target folder we need to be root (fakeroot is
			enough to pack, but not to unpack). So please be ready to enter your
			user password for sudo.

			Enter the target folder name here. It can be either absolute or
			relative to the Freetz build system's base directory (where e.g.
			fwmod is located).
