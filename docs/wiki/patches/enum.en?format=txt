[http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/ENUM ENUM] can be used to translate telephone numbers into IP addresses, much alike [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System DNS] is used to translate domain names into IP adresses. This makes point-to-point telephony possible (for example from Fritz!!Box to Fritz!!Box), bypassing (internet) telephony companies. For this you need a working SIP server. You can read [http://www.wershoven.com/fritzbox/ here] about how to setup a SIP server and [http://www.wehavemorefun.de/fritzbox/index.php/Versteckte_Features#ENUM-Lookup here] about changing the ENUM servers (both in German).
