= Welcome to Freetz =
'''''Freetz''''' (more about the name and history in the [wiki:FAQ.en FAQs]) is a firmware-extension (modification) for the [http://www.avm.de/en/Produkte/FRITZBox/index.html AVM Fritz!Box] and devices with identical hardware. The original firmware from the manufacturer is extended with new functions and programs which may be selected by the user. ''Freetz'' is [http://www.germany.fsfeurope.org/documents/freesoftware.en.html free software] and is developed by Oliver Metz, Alexander Kriegisch and others.

'''Warning: the installation of a modified firmware invalidates the manufacturer's warranty! '''

Since most of the development team and users are German, most of this website is written in the German language.
