=== rc.<package> ===

Responsible to start/stop the deamon with the proper parameters, and having the package included in the menu of the web-interface.[[br]]
An executable Shell script.[[br]]
The configdata (e.g. <package>.conf) will be created as part of the rc.<package> script, before the deamon is started.

In the build environment located at:[[br]]
 ~/freetz-trunk/make/files/root/etc/init.d/rc.<package>

On the router located at:[[br]]
 /mod/etc/init.d/rc.<package>[[br]][[br]]

The /mod/etc/init.d is part of the PATH variable so the rc.<package> scripts can be executed from all locations.[[br]]
 # echo $PATH[[br]]
 /mod/sbin:/mod/bin:/mod/usr/sbin:/mod/usr/bin:/mod/etc/init.d:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

Executing the rc script with an unrecognized parameter will return the usage information of the specific rc.<package> script. e.g.:
 rc.<package> --help
 Usage: /mod/etc/init.d/rc.<package> [load|unload|start|stop|remove|restart|status]

=== rc script ===

To find example just use {{{find}}} on the build environment from {{{~/freetz-trunk/make/}}}:
 find ./*/files/root/etc/init.d/ -name rc.* | grep -v .svn

This gives a list of existing scripts already part of freetz you can look at.[[br]]

The content of a very generic rc script:
{{{
#!/bin/sh

DAEMON=<package>
PID_FILE=/var/run/$DAEMON.pid
. /etc/init.d/modlibrc

start() {
        modlib_startdaemon $DAEMON --config /mod/etc/$DAEMON.conf
        }

case $1 in
     ""|load)
                modreg cgi '<package>' '<package>'
                modreg daemon $DAEMON

                modlib_start $<PACKANG>_ENABLED
                ;;
        unload)
                modunreg daemon $DAEMON
                modunreg cgi '<package>'
                modlib_stop
                ;;
        start)
                modlib_start
                ;;
        stop)
                modlib_stop
                ;;
        restart)
                modlib_restart
                ;;
        status)
                modlib_status
                ;;
        *)
                echo "Usage: $0 [load|unload|start|stop|restart|status]" 1>&2
                exit 1
                ;;
esac

exit 0
}}}

The {{{/etc/init.d/modlibrc}}} script will use the variables defined in the part before this script is called.[[br]]
E.g. {{{DAEMON}}} and {{{PID_FILE}}} as shown in the generic example.[[br]]

This script firsts sets the PATH variable and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.[[br]]
The PATH defines the paths to locations of binaries that should be executable system wide.[[br]]
The LD_LIBRARY_PATH defines the locations of (shared) libraries.[[br]]

PATH variable:
 # echo $PATH[[br]]
 /mod/sbin:/mod/bin:/mod/usr/sbin:/mod/usr/bin:/mod/etc/init.d:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
[[br]]
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:
 # echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH[[br]]
 /mod/lib:/mod/usr/lib

==== rc.<package> (or rc.<packages> load) ====
At system startup the rc.<package> script is invoked without any parameters. This causes the following to happen:
1. the {{{/etc/init.d/modlibrc}}} script to run
1. next the package loaded in the web-interface menu with the {{{modreg cgi '<package>' '<package>'}}} line
1. {{{modreg daemon $DAEMON}}} validates if /mod/etc/init.d/rc.<package> exist, not sure what happens in the {{{replace}}} function.
1. If parameter {{{<PACKAGE>_ENABLED}}} is yes (not no) the function {{{start()}}} is called, which should start the package with its configured parameters.

==== rc.<package> start ====
if rc.<package> start is executed, and the main case statement for start) contains modlib_start it with execute the modlib_start function of /etc/init.d/modlibrc.  
If modlib_start is executed without any parameters it will first verify if the daemon is already running using function moblib_check_running, which returns a interger indicating the daemon state.
Possible states: : 0 already running, 3 stopped, or 5 inetd
If state 0 'already running' is returned, it will just perform: echo "Starting ${DAEMON_LONG_NAME} ... already running."
If state 3 'stopped' is returned, it will initiate the start function part of the rc.<package> script, and return the exit status of the last command which was executed.

==== rc.<package> stop ====
if rc.<package> stop is executed, and the main case statement for stop) contains modlib_stop it with execute the modlib_stop function of /etc/init.d/modlibrc.  
If modlib_stop is executed it will first verify if the daemon current state using function moblib_check_running, which returns a interger indicating the daemon state.
Possible states: : 0 already running, 3 stopped, or 5 inetd
If state 0 'already running' is returned, it will execute the following fuctions, if available, from the rc.<pacakge> script:
If availabel if will first execute the 'stop_pre' function. Next the 'stop' fuction with parameter '0', followed by the 'stop_post' function. 
If the stop function returned a 0 exit code, and after the 3 functions the pid released (kill -0 pid) it will execute: echo 'done.', else it will execute: echo 'failed.' with the returned exit code of the stop function.
If state 3 'stopped' is returned, it will will just perform: echo 'not running.'

==== rc.<package> restart ====
if rc.<package> restart is executed, and the main case statement for restart) contains modlib_restart it with execute the modlib_restart function of /etc/init.d/modlibrc.  
This fuction will just execute modlib_stop, followed by modlib_start.

==== rc.<package> status ====
The rc.<package> status is executed if the web-interface needs to determine if the package is running or stopped.
A return code of 1 means stopped, a return code of 0 means running.


=== verify rc script ===
If you run into issues with the script you can verify the rc script on the Fritz!Box with the following command:
 sh -x rc.<package> [command]

This will execute each step, and show the intermediate results. This is very helpful to locate an issue.[[br]]
Perform this for 'start', 'stop', and 'status'
