If you need instant help you can try the fritzbox IRC channel. Some of the developers are known to sometimes hang out on there: ##fritzbox on Freenode.

If you have any trouble while connecting (Unauthorized connection), please use an alternative server. Maybe you need one from your country. You could find an overview about the Freenod-servers here:
