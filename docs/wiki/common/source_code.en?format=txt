= Source code =

The Freetz source code is managed in a [http://subversion.apache.org Subversion] repository. Subversion is generally abbreviated by SVN.

== Developer version (trunk) ==

/!\ This version is only for experienced users and developers who know how to help themselves! The trunk changes continuously and might temporarily contain bugs or not work at all.

Check out from SVN:
{{{
$ svn co http://svn.freetz.org/trunk                     <--- check out current trunk revision
$ svn co http://svn.freetz.org/trunk trunk_7843 -r 7843  <--- check out specific trunk revision (here: 7843) into subdirectory
                                                              "trunk_7843", so as not to overwrite the current trunk directory
}}}

Check out from Git (/!\ Git is not the leading system and is officially unsupported presently. We provide it "as is" for test purposes.):
{{{
$ git clone https://github.com/Freetz/freetz.git freetz-devel  <--- freetz-devel: local copy of Git repository
}}}

== Stable version ==

/!\ '''The "stable" version is not maintained anymore. Newer boxes as well as firmwares are not available there. Please use whenever possible the trunk as mentioned above.''' /!\

For some box types no firmware is available on AVM servers. Help yourself using this [http://freetz.org/wiki/FAQ#Couldnotdownloadfirmwareimage info].

Depending on your hardware type you need one of the following Freetz versions:

'''freetz-2.0''': current stable version (list of supported boxes and [source:tags/freetz-2.0/FIRMWARES#L3 firmware versions])
{{{
$ svn co http://svn.freetz.org/branches/freetz-stable-2.0
}}}

'''ds-0.2.9-p8''' (kernel 2.4): for very old boxes which do not get AVM firmware updates anymore (more [http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/showthread.php?t=135253 info])
{{{
$ svn co http://svn.freetz.org/tags/ds-0.2.9-p8
}}}
