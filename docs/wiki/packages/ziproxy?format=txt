"''Ziproxy is a forwarding (non-caching) compressing HTTP proxy server. Basically, it squeezes images by converting them to lower quality JPEGs  or JPEG 2000 and compresses (gzip) HTML and other text-like data. It also provides other features such as: HTML/JS/CSS optimization,  preemptive hostname resolution, transparent proxying, IP ToS marking  (QoS), Ad-Blocker, detailed logging and more.''"

Useful when bandwidth is limited, for example on slow GPRS connections or on slow or heavily shared internet connections in developing countries (typical in internet cafes).

It is possible to use ziproxy as normal proxy by disabling the options ''GZip compression'' and ''Compress images''.

Ziproxy supports inet.

== CPU usage ==
Relatively heavy.

It may be necessary to disable the watchdog by adding this line to for example ''rc.custom'':

{{{
echo "disable">/dev/watchdog
}}}
== Memory usage ==
After a fresh start:

''!VmSize'': ~1800 kB[[BR]] ''VmRSS'': ~375 kB

== URL no processing list ==
You want probably at least:

{{{
http://mt*.google.com/*
http://khm*.google.com/*
http://maps.gstatic.com/*
}}}
== URL deny list ==
[[Screenshot(218,align=right)]]

Something like:

{{{
http://*.doubleclick.net/*
http://*.googleadservices.com/*
http://*.google-analytics.com/*
http://*.googlesyndication.com/*
http://adserver.*/*
http://ads.*/*
http://ad.*/*
http://*.facebook.com/plugins*
http://*.facebook.com/widgets*
http://*.fbcdn.net/ads*/*
}}}
and maybe:

{{{
http://*/*.swf
}}}
