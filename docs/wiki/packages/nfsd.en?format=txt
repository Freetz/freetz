== NFSD_CGI ==

NFSD_CGI is the web-interface for the NFSD (Server) on Freetz.[[br]]


Some observations:[[br]]
Currently using NFS with a 7390 using Freetz-trunk revision 11466.[[br]]
Using this revision I didn't observe permission issues like with Freetz-1.2 for my 7270v3.[[br]]
As mount I'm using a [/wiki/packages/ndas NDAS-NetDisk] which is Ext3 formatted.[[br]]

 


=== /etc/exports (exports in GUI) ===

My currect config allows 192.168.178.0/24 and localhost (for the local NFS Client).[[br]]

{{{
/var/media/ndas/ext3 192.168.178.0/255.255.250.0(rw,no_subtree_check) localhost(rw)
}}}

=== /etc/hosts.allow ===

Looks only the first two lines are needed, but the others should not harm.[[br]]

{{{
mountd,nfsd,portmap: 192.168.178.0/255.255.255.0 , localhost
lockd: 192.168.178.0/255.255.255.0 , localhost
rquotad: 192.168.178.0/255.255.255.0 , localhost
statd: 192.168.178.0/255.255.255.0 , localhost
}}}

=== /etc/hosts.deny ===

Only deny the NFS related services[[br]]
{{{
mountd,nfsd,portmap:ALL
lockd:ALL
rquotad:ALL
statd:ALL
}}}

=== Verification on Server: ===

Below some helpfull commands for trouble-shooting on the server.[[br]]
Unfortunately {{{rpcinfo}}} and {{{nfsstat}}} where not available on my FB. Maybe {{{rpcinfo}}} is available if 'replace kernel' is used.[[br]]

List of kernel supported filesystems by the FB:
{{{
cat /proc/filesystems
}}}
Just look if the filesystems you are planning to use are listed.[[br]]

{{{
/etc/init.d/rc.nfsd status
}}}
Status should be {{{running}}}. Use the following {{{ps}}} command first to see which processes are actually running before restarting the nfs server.[[br]]

{{{
ps -wl | grep 'nfs\|portmap\|lockd\|statd\|mountd\|quota'
}}}
portmap, lockd, mountd, and nfsd should be all listed as a process.[[br]]
You can use {{{/etc/init.d/rc.nfsd stop}}} and {{{/etc/init.d/rc.nfsd start}}} to stop and start the nfs server.[[br]] 

{{{
exportfs
}}}
Should show the hosts or subnets (incl. localhost if configured) configured in /etc/exports[[br]]

{{{
mount
}}}
Look that the mounted disk allows rw (if intended)[[br]]

If you also have the [/wiki/packages/nfs.en NFS Client] installed on the FB, the following verification is available:
{{{
mount -t nfs localhost:/<share-path> /<mount-point> 
}}}

To show from the server which nfs exports are in use:
{{{
showmount --all
showmount --exports
}}}

To verify layer-4 network information (e.g. used ports):
{{{
netstat -anp
}}}

[[br]]

{{{
logread
}}}


=== rsize and wsize buffers ===
The read and write buffers are assigned during the {{{mount}}} on the client.[[br]]
The server supports a buffer size that range from 4kbytes to 1024kbytes (RPCSVC_MAXPAYLOAD (1*1024*1024u)) in steps of 1kbyte.[[br]]
Finding the optimal buffer size is normally the best option to get a better performance.[[br]]
I only have a ndas Net-Disk mounted, and found that all rsize values had a similar variation in the results.[[br]]
The FB CPU is the bottleneck.[[br]]
It might be interesting to retest this with a USB-stick to see if than varying the buffersizes would show a difference.[[br]] 

I tested the performance with [http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++ Bonnie++] using one of the [http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/experimental/ experimental versions][[br]]

==== Bonnie++ ====
For this I used two scripts to: run the test, unmount/mount both client and server mounts, restart nfsd, and mounted the client with a different rsize parameter.[[br]]
During the tests I only varied the rsize parameter, because I'm only interested in the read optimalisation now, but changing both wsize and rsize is also possible.[[br]]
Each test takes about 35 minutes (with 1gigbyte transfers), so you can do about 16 overnight.[[br]]
Here the scripts I used:

main script:
{{{
#!/bin/sh

# the initial test with a rsize of 32768 (=32k) and increased with steps of 32k to 1024k
# rsize=32768
# for the second test again 32 test using 1gigabyte using the best result -16*1k to +16*1k
# rsize to test is rsize=294912. Start rsize is
rsize=(294912-16384)
i=1
date > results.txt
date +%s >> results.txt
while [ $i -le 32 ]; do
        echo ======================================================= >> results.txt
        echo =======================================================
        echo setup bonny++ test with rsize of $(($rsize+1024*$i))
        echo setup bonny++ test with rsize of $(($rsize+1024*$i)) >> results.txt
        mount -o hard,intr,rsize=$(($rsize+1024*$i)) 192.168.178.1:<full_share_path> <local_mount_point>
        bonnie++ -d <local_mount_point> -s 1g -n 0 -m nfs_client_$rsize -f -b -u root >> results.txt 2>> results.txt
        echo ======================================================= >> results.txt
        umount <local_mount_point>
        expect autologin.sh
        i=$(($i + 1))
done
date >> results.txt
date +%s >> results.txt
}}}

expect script:
{{{
#!/usr/bin/expect

spawn ssh root@192.168.178.1
# expect "connecting (yes/no)?"
# send "yes\r"
expect "assword:"
send "<your_passwd>\r"
expect "#"
send "/etc/init.d/rc.nfsd stop\r"
expect "done."
send "umount /dev/nda2\r"
expect "#"
send "mount /dev/nda2 <mount-point>\r"
expect "#"
send "/etc/init.d/rc.nfsd start\r"
expect "done."
}}}

You can obtain a nice html page of your results with:
{{{
cat results.txt | grep ,,, | bon_csv2html > /tmp/nfs_client_test.html
}}}
But you can also use the csv format output in an Excel sheet.
I attached 3 html files showing my results.

==== MRTG CPU Util ====
[[Screenshot(276,width=300,height=100,align=left)]]
In the [/wiki/packages/netsnmp.en MRTG] graph of the CPU Utilization you can clearly see that the CPU Utilization is the bottleneck in my setup using a [/wiki/packages/ndas NDAS NetDisk].[[br]]
The picture shows I started the test at about 7:20am which took until 1:10am the next day.[[br]] Than I did two manual bonny++ tests at 1:15am and 2am. Than started a new batch test using the scripts at about 2:45am.[[br]][[br]][[br]][[br]][[br]]
