= s3fslite =
"''s3fslite is a fork of s3fs, originally written by Randy Rizun. It is a file system that stores all data in an Amazon S3 bucket. It allows access to a bucket as though it were a local file system. It is useful for publishing static web data that can be read easily by a browser, or for backing up private or shared data.''"

== Usage ==
See the home page for detailed usage instructions. Be sure to specify the following options:

{{{
-o attr_cache=
-o writeback_cache=
}}}
to a non-memory location to prevent running out of memory when storing larger files (your box could crash and reboot).

For example:

{{{
s3fs <bucket> <mount point> \
-o attr_cache=/var/media/ftp/uStor01/... \
-o writeback_cache=/var/media/ftp/uStor01/...
}}}
You can store your credentials in ''/tmp/flash/passwd-s3fs'', if you don't want to specify them on the command line.[[BR]]

It is possible to use a ''mime.types'' file, if you want to access your  objects from internet: (for example for a static web site) 


 * Copy ''/etc/mime.types'' to your box, for example to '' /var/media/ftp/uStor01/mime.types''
 * Create a symbolic link like this: ''ln -s  /var/media/ftp/uStor01/mime.types /tmp/flash/mime.types''

Using ''rsync'' to make backups:

{{{
rsync -avW --delete /source-folder/ /mount-point/
}}}
Advice: read the man page of rsync, before using it.
