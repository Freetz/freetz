# Static addons
#
#Extract the addon archive into this ./addon/ directory.
#Example: ./addon/own-files-0.1/
#
#To enable an addon, add the name of the addon directory
#to this file. Example: own-files-0.1
#
#You could also use seperate *.pkg files for each addon.
#It's recommended to not include the version in the file
#name, like 'own-files.pkg' with content 'own-files-0.1'.
