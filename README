Acknowledgements:
- DS-Mod was originally named after Daniel Eiband's (special thanks to Daniel)
	user name "danisahne" at ip-phone-forum.de (IPPF). He has built it based
	on the work of Erik Andersen, Christian Volkmann and others not mentioned,
	but nevertheless honoured here.
- Some time ago the developers decided to rename the project to Freetz.
	The reason for doing so can be refered here:
	https://freetz.github.io/wiki/FAQ.html

The fun has just begun!
 Your Freetz developer team
